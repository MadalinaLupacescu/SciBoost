# Sciboost


The tool assists in searching medical databases for adverse effects reported in the literature.
This project is specifically for the LMU Klinikum Laboratory, which focuses on identifying and addressing therapeutic resistance in gastrointestinal cancers to personalize drug selection.

A fine-tuned SciBERT model for the task of identifying drug-adverse effect entities through Named Entity Recognition (NER) is used as a core of the tool (1).
The entities will be mapped to MedDRA, and alongside the identified entities, various study characteristics will be visualized for users.
