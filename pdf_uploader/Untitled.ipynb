       "  'AB': \"The human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family of receptor tyrosine kinases plays an important role in the biology of many cancers. In breast and gastrointestinal cancer, and at lower rates also in additional tumor types, HER2 and its homo- or heterodimerization with HER1 or HER3 are essential for cancer cell growth and survival. Breast cancer patients overexpressing HER2 have a more aggressive course of their disease. The poor prognosis associated with HER2 overexpression can be substantially improved by adding HER2-targeted therapy to standard of care using the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab. Lapatinib, an oral dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor, blocks HER1 and HER2 tyrosine kinase activity by binding to the ATP-binding site of the receptor's intracellular domain, resulting in inhibition of tumor cell growth. Lapatinib is generally well tolerated with diarrhea being the most common adverse effect. However, although being mainly of mild to moderate severity, interruption or discontinuation of treatment has been reported in a substantial proportion of patients in clinical trials. In 2007, lapatinib has been approved in combination with capecitabine in patients with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer upon progressive disease following standard therapy with anthracyclines, taxanes, and trastuzumab. In 2013, the approval was extended to a chemotherapy-free combination with trastuzumab for patients with metastatic HER2-positive, hormone receptor-negative breast cancer progressing on prior trastuzumab and chemotherapy. Since 2010, lapatinib is approved in combination with letrozole in the treatment of postmenopausal women with advanced HER2- and hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. In contrast, in first-line cytotoxic-based therapy of both early and advanced HER2-positive breast cancer, data from clinical trials did not provide evidence of additional benefit of lapatinib compared to trastuzumab. Moreover, over the past few years, novel HER2-targeted drugs, either alone or as a combined anti-HER2 approach, have been extensively evaluated, demonstrating a more favorable outcome. Also, neither in first- nor second-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer, lapatinib has been proven to be superior compared to trastuzumab as hitherto standard of care HER2 blockade. Therefore, lapatinib has become somewhat less important in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer during the past 10\\xa0years since its first introduction. Nevertheless, consideration of treatment with lapatinib appears to be reasonable in selected patients not only in the approved applications but also beyond, and further indications such as HER2-positive refractory metastatic colorectal cancer may arise in future. Also, lapatinib may have distinct advantages over antibodies in targeting truncated HER2 and crossing the blood-brain barrier. Finally, the favorable cardiac toxicity profile of lapatinib makes it an attractive alternative to trastuzumab-based regimens in patients at risk for cardiac events.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'Chemotherapy-induced neuropathy is a common, dose-dependent adverse effect of several antineoplastics. It can lead to detrimental dose reductions and discontinuation of treatment, and severely affects the quality of life of cancer survivors. Clinically, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy presents as deficits in sensory, motor, and autonomic function which develop in a glove and stocking distribution due to preferential effects on longer axons. The pathophysiological processes are multi-factorial and involve oxidative stress, apoptotic mechanisms, altered calcium homeostasis, axon degeneration and membrane remodeling as well as immune processes and neuroinflammation. This review focusses on the commonly used antineoplastic substances oxaliplatin, cisplatin, vincristine, docetaxel, and paclitaxel which interfere with the cancer cell cycle-leading to cell death and tumor degradation-and cause severe acute and chronic peripheral neuropathies. We discuss drug mechanism of action and pharmacokinetic disposition relevant to the development of peripheral neuropathy, the epidemiology and clinical presentation of chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, emerging insight into genetic susceptibilities as well as current understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment approaches.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'CONTEXT: Multiple treatments for metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) are available, but their effects on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and benefit-harm balance remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess clinical effectiveness regarding survival and HRQoL, safety, and benefit-harm balance of mHSPC treatments. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov until March 1, 2022. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing docetaxel, abiraterone, enzalutamide, apalutamide, darolutamide, and radiotherapy combined with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) mutually or with ADT alone were eligible. Three reviewers independently performed screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment in duplicate. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Across ten RCTs, we found relevant survival benefits for ADT\\xa0+\\xa0docetaxel (high certainty according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation [GRADE]), ADT\\xa0+\\xa0abiraterone (moderate certainty), ADT\\xa0+\\xa0enzalutamide (low certainty), ADT\\xa0+\\xa0apalutamide (high certainty), and ADT\\xa0+\\xa0docetaxel\\xa0+\\xa0darolutamide (high certainty) compared with ADT alone. ADT\\xa0+\\xa0radiotherapy appeared effective only in low-volume de novo mHSPC. We found a short-term HRQoL decrease lasting 3-6 mo for ADT\\xa0+\\xa0docetaxel (moderate certainty) and a potential HRQoL benefit for ADT\\xa0+\\xa0abiraterone up to 24 mo of follow-up (moderate certainty) compared with ADT alone. There was no difference in HRQoL for ADT\\xa0+\\xa0enzalutamide, ADT\\xa0+\\xa0apalutamide, or ADT\\xa0+\\xa0radiotherapy over ADT alone (low-high certainty). Grade 3-5 adverse effect rates were increased with all systemic combination treatments. A benefit-harm assessment showed high probabilities (>60%) for a net clinical benefit with ADT\\xa0+\\xa0abiraterone, ADT\\xa0+\\xa0enzalutamide, and ADT\\xa0+\\xa0apalutamide, while ADT\\xa0+\\xa0docetaxel and ADT\\xa0+\\xa0docetaxel\\xa0+\\xa0darolutamide appeared unlikely (<40%) to be beneficial. CONCLUSIONS: Despite substantial survival benefits, no systemic combination treatment showed a clear HRQoL improvement compared with ADT alone. We found evidence for a short-term HRQoL decline with ADT\\xa0+\\xa0docetaxel and a higher net clinical benefit with ADT\\xa0+\\xa0abiraterone, ADT\\xa0+\\xa0apalutamide and ADT\\xa0+\\xa0enzalutamide. While individualized decision-making remains important and economic factors need to be considered, the evidence may support a general preference for the combination of ADT with androgen receptor axis-targeted therapies over docetaxel-containing strategies. PATIENT SUMMARY: We assessed different combination treatments for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. While survival was better with all systemic combination treatments, there was no clear improvement in health-related quality of life compared with androgen deprivation therapy alone. Novel hormonal combination treatments had a more favorable benefit-harm balance than combination treatments that include chemotherapy.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'The development of checkpoint inhibitors has changed the treatment paradigm for cancer. Checkpoint inhibitors nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and cemiplimab target programmed death-1 (PD-1), whereas durvalumab, avelumab, and atezolizumab target PD-ligand 1. Ipilimumab targets cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4. Used as monotherapy or in combination, these inhibitors have shown remarkable efficacy in melanoma, lung cancer, urothelial cancer, and many other solid tumors, and indications are continuing to evolve. Checkpoint inhibitors are well tolerated when compared with traditional chemotherapy. The major adverse effect profiles are idiosyncratic immune-mediated toxicities resulting from the abnormal activation of autoreactive T cells, which can lead to inflammation in any organ system. The most commonly affected organs are bowel, lung, skin, and endocrine. Pulmonary toxicity is important to recognize, and it can be more challenging to diagnose in lung cancer patients, given the nature of the disease course and treatment. This review article focuses on all of the pulmonary adverse effects of a single PD-1 inhibitor (nivolumab) that have been described in the literature. These complications include dyspnea, pneumonitis, pleural effusion, pulmonary sarcoidosis, pulmonary tuberculosis, acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia, organizing pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and lung cavitation. Clinicians must be aware of these toxicities and mindful when prescribing these medications in patients with known lung dysfunction due to chronic lung diseases or lung cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Fluorouracil (FU) is an antimetabolite with activity against numerous types of neoplasms, including those of the breast, esophagus, larynx, and gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. Systemic toxicity, including neutropenia, stomatitis, and diarrhea, often occur due to cytotoxic nonselectivity. Capecitabine was developed as a prodrug of FU, with the goal of improving tolerability and intratumor drug concentrations through tumor-specific conversion to the active drug. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this article is to review the available information on capecitabine with respect to clinical pharmacology, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, clinical efficacy for breast and colorectal cancer adverse-effect profile, documented drug interactions, dosage and administration, and future directions of ongoing research. METHODS: Relevant English-language literature was identified through searches of PubMed (1966 to August 2004), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1977 to August 2004), and the Proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (January 1995 to August 2004). Search terms included capecitabine, Xeloda, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer. The references of the identified articles were reviewed for additional sources. In addition, product information was obtained from Roche Pharmaceuticals. Studies from the identified literature that addressed this article's objectives were selected for review, with preference given to Phase II/III trials. RESULTS: Capecitabine is an oral prodrug that is converted to its only active metabolite, FU, by thymidine phosphorylase. Higher levels of this enzyme are found in several tumors and the liver, compared with normal healthy tissue. In adults, capecitabine has a bioavailability of approximately 100% with a Cmax of 3.9 mg/L, Tmax of 1.5 to 2 hr, and AUC of 5.96 mg.h/L. The predominant route of elimination is renal, and dosage reduction of 75% is recommended in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 30 to 50 mL/min. The drug is contraindicated if CrCl is < 30 mL/min. Capecitabine has shown varying degrees of efficacy with acceptable tolerability in numerous cancers including prostate, renal cell, ovarian, and pancreatic, with the largest amount of evidence in metastatic breast and colorectal cancer. Single-agent capecitabine was compared with IV FU/leucovorin (LV) using the bolus Mayo Clinic regimen in 2 Phase III trials as first-line treatment for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Overall response rate (RR) favored the capecitabine arm (26% vs 17%, P < 0.001); however, this did not translate into a difference in time to progression (TTP) (4.6 months vs 4.7 months) or overall survival (OS) (12.9 months vs 12.8 months). In Phase II noncomparative trials, combinations of capecitabine with oxaliplatin or irinotecan have produced results similar to regimens combining FU/LV with the same agents in patients with colorectal cancer. In metastatic breast cancer patients who had received prior treatment with an anthracycline-based regimen, a Phase III trial comparing the combination of capecitabine with docetaxel versus docetaxel alone demonstrated superior objective tumor RR (42% vs 30%, P = 0.006), median TTP (6.1 months vs 4.2 months, P < 0.001), and median OS (14.5 months vs 11.5 months, P = 0.013) with the combination treatment. Noncomparative Phase II studies have also supported efficacy in patients with metastatic breast cancer pretreated with both anthracyclines and taxanes, yielding an overall RR of 15% to 29% and median OS of 9.4 to 15.2 months. The most common dose-limiting adverse effects associated with capecitabine monotherapy are hyperbilirubinemia, diarrhea, and hand-foot syndrome. Myelosuppression, fatigue and weakness, abdominal pain, and nausea have also been reported. Compared with bolus FU/LV, capecitabine was associated with more hand-foot syndrome but less stomatitis, alopecia, neutropenia requiring medical management, diarrhea, and nausea. Capecitabine has been reported to increase serum phenytoin levels and the international normalized ratio in patients receiving concomitant phenytoin and warfarin, respectively. The dose of capecitabine approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for both metastatic colorectal and breast cancer is 1250 Mg/M2 given orally twice per day, usually separated by 12 hours for the first 2 weeks of every 3-week cycle. CONCLUSIONS: Capecitabine is currently approved by the FDA for use as first-line therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer when single-agent fluoropyrimidine therapy is preferred. The drug is also approved for use as (1) a single agent in metastatic breast cancer patients who are resistant to both anthracycline- and paclitaxel-based regimens or in whom further anthracycline treatment is contra indicated and (2) in combination with docetaxel after failure of prior anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Single-agent and combination regimens have also shown benefits in patients with prostate, pancreatic, renal cell, and ovarian cancers. Improved tolerability and comparable efficacy compared with IV FU/LV in addition to oral administration make capecitabine an attractive option for the treatment of several types of cancers as well as the focus of future trials.\",\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Cancer immunotherapy, such as anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1), has revolutionized the treatment of malignancies by engaging the patient's own immune system against the tumor rather than targeting the cancer directly. These therapies have demonstrated a significant benefit in the treatment of melanomas and other cancers. SUMMARY: In order to provide an extensive overview of the renal toxicities induced by these agents, a Medline search was conducted of published literature related to ipilimumab-, pembrolizumab-, and nivolumab-induced kidney toxicity. In addition, primary data from the initial clinical trials of these agents and the FDA adverse reporting system database were also reviewed to determine renal adverse events. Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), podocytopathy, and hyponatremia were toxicities caused by ipilimumab. The main adverse effect associated with both the PD-1 inhibitors was AIN. The onset of kidney injury seen with PD-1 inhibitors is usually late (3-10 months) compared to CTLA-4 antagonists related renal injury, which happens earlier (2-3 months). PD-1 as opposed to CTLA-4 inhibitors has been associated with kidney rejection in transplantation. Steroids appear to be effective in treating the immune-related adverse effects noted with these agents. Key Message: Although initially thought to be rare, the incidence rates of renal toxicities might be higher (9.9-29%) as identified by recent studies. As a result, obtaining knowledge about renal toxicities of immune checkpoint inhibitors is extremely important.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Lenvatinib combined with pembrolizumab showed a promising result in an early phase study for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The efficacy and safety of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab for patients with unresectable HCC (uHCC) beyond the first-line setting were unclear. METHODS: Seventy-one consecutive patients who received lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab for uHCC were prospectively enrolled. Effect of lenvatinib combinations on Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) score and factors associated with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 71 cases, 58 (81.7%) were in BCLC C. There were 44 (62%) for the first-line systemic treatment, and 27 (38%) had experienced targeted therapy or nivolumab treatment. The objective response rate and disease control rate (DCR) were 34.1% and 84.1% for the first-line setting, and 18.5% and 70.4% for systemic therapy-experienced cases (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1, RECIST v1.1), respectively. The mean ALBI score was stable during the treatment course. After a median of 9.3\\xa0months of follow-up, the median PFS was 9.3\\xa0months versus 4.4\\xa0months, and the median OS was not estimable yet versus 12\\xa0months for Child-Pugh A versus B patients, respectively. Prior nivolumab failure was the only significant factor associated with poorer PFS (HR\\u2009=\\u20093.253, p\\u2009=\\u20090.004). Child-Pugh class B (HR\\u2009=\\u20092.646, p\\u2009=\\u20090.039) and prior nivolumab failure (HR\\u2009=\\u20093.340, p\\u2009=\\u20090.014) were independent factors for poorer OS in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: A high DCR was observed by lenvatinib/pembrolizumab combination without adverse effect on ALBI score for systemic therapy-naïve and -experienced uHCC. Suboptimal response to prior nivolumab-failed patients requires further exploration.',\n",

Among them, paclitaxel and docetaxel are most commonly administered, but newer formulations are being investigated. Taxane antineoplastic activity is mainly based on the ability of the drugs to promote microtubule assembly, leading to mitotic arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells. Peripheral neurotoxicity is the major non-hematological adverse effect of taxane, often manifested as painful neuropathy experienced during treatment, and it is sometimes irreversible. Unfortunately, taxane-induced neurotoxicity is an uncertainty prior to the initiation of treatment. The present review aims to dissect current knowledge on real incidence, underlying pathophysiology, clinical features and predisposing factors related with the development of taxane-induced neuropathy.',\n",

In this review article, we comprehensively discuss the incidence, clinical presentation, prevention and management of anti-cancer agent-induced renal dysfunction. We focus on both relatively new anti-cancer agents (bevacizumab, gefitinib, gemcitabine, imatinib, rituximab and trastuzumab) and traditional agents (cisplatin, methotrexate, ifosfamide and taxanes) to cover a selection of the most frequently used anti-cancer agents.

Skin manifestations have been most described in current literature highlighting the most common adverse effects of this agent. However, adverse outcomes involving the oral mucosa have been rarely identified in the PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitor classes of immunotherapeutic agents. We present a case of a 71-year-old male who was treated with a chemotherapeutic regimen including pembrolizumab for newly diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, who later developed ulcerations on his tongue that were consistent with glossitis. Upon determining that this adverse effect may be immune-related, the patient was treated with oral prednisone 40 mg with a 10 mg taper each subsequent week, which resulted in significant improvement in the patient's symptoms following one month of treatment.\",\n",

The standard intermittent dosage of docetaxel is 60-100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. At this dose and schedule, myelosuppression is common and neutropenia is usually the dose-limiting toxicity. Weekly administration of docetaxel 20-42 mg/m2 is being tested in the treatment of advanced solid tumors in order to improve patient tolerance by reducing the interval dose and to maintain therapeutic efficacy by increasing overall dose intensity. Asthenia and peripheral neuropathy can limit continued administration of weekly docetaxel. Epiphora (excess tearing due to narrowing or blockage of the lacrimal outflow passages) is associated with repeated weekly administration of docetaxel. This adverse effect can interfere with activities of daily life and negatively affect quality of life. Epiphora may be an underreported adverse effect of treatment because of underrecognition by clinicians and patient embarrassment with respect to seemingly uncontrolled tearing. The use of weekly docetaxel administration is expanding; therefore, patients should be educated to recognize and report signs and symptoms of epiphora. It is important for clinicians participating in the care of patients undergoing treatment with docetaxel to monitor for excess tearing and signs of eye irritation to ensure timely management of treatment-related epiphora.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a dose-limiting adverse effect of taxanes. We sought to evaluate the effect of exercise on taxane CIPN in women with breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women (n\\xa0= 27) were randomized to immediate exercise (IE, during taxane chemotherapy) or delayed exercise (DE, after chemotherapy). Supervised aerobic, resistance, and balance training was offered 3 days a week for 8-12 weeks. CIPN symptoms and quality of life were assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ) C30 and CIPN20 (scored from 0 to 100). The percentage of participants reporting moderate to severe sensory symptoms ('3/4' or '4/4' for CIPN20 sensory items) was also evaluated, along with clinical sensory testing at the lower limb (vibration sense and pinprick). Taxane treatment adherence, including relative dose intensity, was extracted from patient medical records. Assessments occurred at: baseline (before taxane chemotherapy), pre-cycle 4 (before the final taxane cycle), the end of chemotherapy, and follow-up (10-15 weeks after chemotherapy). RESULTS: No differences in the EORTC QLQ CIPN20 symptom scores were detected between groups at any time point. At pre-cycle 4, there was a significant difference between groups in patient-reported moderate to severe numbness in the toes or feet (IE: n = 1, 9%, DE: n = 7, 50%, P\\xa0= .04) and impaired vibration sense in the feet (IE: n = 2, 18%, DE: n = 10, 83%, P\\xa0< .01). Overall global health status/quality of life was higher in IE compared to DE at the end of chemotherapy (P\\xa0= .05), yet both groups had worse CIPN20 sensory (Δ24.3 ± 4.6, P\\xa0< .01) and motor symptom scores (Δ10.5 ± 1.9, P\\xa0< .01) relative to baseline. By the end of chemotherapy, no differences between groups were found for\\xa0moderate to severe numbness in the toes or feet (P\\xa0= 1.0) or impaired vibration sense in the feet (P = .71). More IE participants received\\xa0≥ 85% relative dose intensity (IE: n = 12, 100%, DE: n\\xa0= 10, 67%, P\\xa0< .05). CONCLUSION: Exercise may attenuate CIPN over the course of taxane chemotherapy and possibly improve taxane adherence in women with breast cancer. These findings, as well as whether exercise can attenuate CIPN by the end of taxane chemotherapy, should be confirmed in larger trials.\",\n",

Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) is overexpressed in 15-20% human breast cancers, which is associated with poor prognosis and a high recurrence rate. Trastuzumab is the first humanized monoclonal antibody against HER-2. The most significant adverse effect of trastuzumab is cardiotoxicity, which has become an important factor in limiting the safe use of the drug. Unfortunately, the mechanism causing this cardiotoxicity is still not completely understood, and the use of preventive interventions remains controversial. This article focuses on trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity, reviewing the clinical application, potential cardiotoxicity, mechanism and discussing the potential interventions through summarizing related researches over the past tens of years.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Systemic oncologic therapies can cause multiple emergency situations. There are, however, two unique emergencies directly related to chemotherapy administration: drug extravasation and hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs). Most drugs can cause varying degrees of local tissue injury when extravasated. The medical management of extravasation is based on proper maintenance of the intravenous line, application of local cooling or warming for certain extravasations, and the use of antidotes to prevent the local toxic action of the extravasated drug. Antidotes that appear useful include hyaluronidase (for vinca alkaloids, epipodophyllotoxins, and paclitaxel), sodium thiosulfate (for mechlorethamine and cisplatin), and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (for anthracyclines and mitomycin C). HSRs, another potential adverse effect of chemotherapy administration, are a major concern for therapy with taxanes and with L-asparaginase, and their administration requires the use of premedication to prevent these reactions. Once a HSR has occurred, therapy may be continued by using an analog drug or by the administration of premedication as prophylaxis, in particular if the reaction was minor. On the other hand, it is also pertinent to become acquainted with the emergencies induced by biological agents, taking into consideration their increasing usages. In addition to interferons and interleukin-2 (IL-2), both of which have been in clinical use for several years, cytokine-toxin fusion proteins (DAB3891L-2) and two monoclonal antibodies (rituximab and trastuzumab) were recently approved for cancer therapy. The distinct toxicity profiles of these agents are reviewed.',\n",

Little attention has been given to oedema as a possible side effect of docetaxel-containing therapies. Until now, no review was conducted to evaluate docetaxel-containing therapies versus docetaxel-free therapies on the magnitude of the risk of developing oedema. In this systematic review, we investigated the risk of developing oedema in patients being treated for breast cancer with or without docetaxel. In this systematic literature review, we searched PubMed and Web of Knowledge for studies on breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy containing docetaxel. We included clinical trials comparing docetaxel versus docetaxel-free chemotherapy. Oedema had to be reported and measured as a key outcome or an adverse effect. Methodological checklists were used to assess the risk of bias within the selected studies. Seven randomised clinical trials were included. Six trials were of moderate methodological quality. All trials showed an increased rate of oedema in the docetaxel-treatment arm. The trial of weakest methodological quality reported the highest incidence of oedema. The results moderately suggest that adjuvant chemotherapy containing docetaxel is related to a significantly increased risk of developing oedema, compared with docetaxel-free chemotherapy.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Cancer remains a major public health problem worldwide and was responsible for 9.6 million deaths in 2018. Oncologic treatments such as doxorubicin (Dox) and trastuzumab (Trz) are chemotherapeutic drugs used to treat several types of cancer, including solid and non-solid malignancies. Although these drugs have a significant impact on the reduction in mortality of cancer patients, this treatment has an adverse effect on the cardiovascular system. The mechanisms associated with Dox-induced cardiotoxicity involve inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, mitochondria impairment and dysregulation of autophagy. Unfortunately, Trz, an effective anti-cancer drug, can potentiate these adverse effects. Trz is a recombinant DNA-derived humanized monoclonal antibody against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Despite its high anti-cancer efficacy, Trz also has a cardiotoxic effect. Unlike Dox, this adverse effect of Trz on the heart is mostly reversible. A strategy to prevent this undesirable effect is urgently needed. Currently, several pharmacological interventions have shown promising results that might effectively attenuate Dox- and Trz-induced cardiac dysfunction. In this review, reports from in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies pertinent to the underlying mechanisms involved in chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity, are comprehensively summarized and discussed. In addition, the potential pharmacological interventions to prevent these cardiotoxic effects are described.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Chemotherapeutic agents directed against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) have significantly improved the prognosis of patients who are positive for this receptor. However, cardiomyopathy remains as a common adverse effect of using these agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literature search was conducted via PubMed using the keywords of \"Trastuzumab Cardiomyopathy,\" \"Lapatinib Cardiomyopathy\" and \"Pertuzumab Cardiomyopathy,\" which provided 104 results. These articles were then screened for relevance to the targeted subject based on their title and abstracts. Case reports and articles that were not discussing any aspect of cardiomyopathy secondary to targeted therapy for breast cancer and articles not in English were eliminated. After elimination, a bibliography search among selected articles was done and a total of 46 articles were identified. The collected articles were then meticulously analyzed and summarized. RESULTS: The use of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) receptor targeted chemotherapy in breast cancer is limited because of a higher incidence (19-22%) of cardiomyopathy. The incidence of cardiomyopathy is not dose dependent and in most cases it is reversible after discontinuation of the drug and treatment with heart failure medications. Severe adverse outcomes including death or permanent disability are rare. CONCLUSION: HER-2 targeted chemotherapy for breast cancer has a higher incidence of associated reversible cardiomyopathy. Patients should be monitored by serial echocardiography starting at the beginning of the treatment and followed by every 3 months until the completion of chemotherapy. Co-ordination between oncologists and cardiologists is needed to develop evidence-based protocols to prevent, identify, monitor and treat trastuzumab-induced cardiomyopathy.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Cancer immunotherapy significantly contributed to an improvement in the prognosis of cancer patients. Immunotherapy, including human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted therapies, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), and chimeric antigen receptor-modified T (CAR-T), share the characteristic to exploit the capabilities of the immune system to kill cancerous cells. Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody against HER2 that prevents HER2-mediated signaling; it is administered mainly in HER2-positive cancers, such as breast, colorectal, biliary tract, and non-small-cell lung cancers. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) inhibit the binding of CTLA-4 or PD-1 to PDL-1, allowing T cells to kill cancerous cells. ICI can be used in melanomas, non-small-cell lung cancer, urothelial, and head and neck cancer. There are two main types of T-cell transfer therapy: tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (or TIL) therapy and chimeric antigen receptor-modified T (CAR-T) cell therapy, mainly applied for B-cell lymphoma and leukemia and mantle-cell lymphoma. HER2-targeted therapies, mainly trastuzumab, are associated with left ventricular dysfunction, usually reversible and rarely life-threatening. PD/PDL-1 inhibitors can cause myocarditis, rare but potentially fulminant and associated with a high fatality rate. CAR-T therapy is associated with several cardiac toxic effects, mainly in the context of a systemic adverse effect, the cytokines release syndrome.',\n",

The recommended dosage for phase II trials is 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks which provides optimal activity with tolerable adverse effects. Docetaxel has shown high single agent activity including use as first- or second-line therapy and in anthracycline refractory breast cancer patients. Results have been comparable to that of established treatments for breast cancer. In addition, docetaxel has shown significant activity in non-small cell lung cancer and a range of other tumors, but no activity in renal or colo-rectal tumors. At present it is undergoing further evaluation in combination therapy. The safety profile of docetaxel is well defined. Major adverse effects include hypersensitivity reactions, fluid retention and neutropenia. Peripheral neuropathy is not a significant adverse effect. The aims of phase II trials with regard to counteracting side-effects are therefore 2-fold: firstly, to evaluate the use of premedication with corticosteroids and antihistamines as a means of counteracting hypersensitivity reactions and fluid retention; secondly, to determine whether granulocyte colony stimulating factor may be useful for attenuating neutropenia.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'INTRODUCTION: Chemotherapy drugs can be responsible of several side effects such as hand-foot syndrome (HFS). This syndrome is also called \"palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia\" and \"acral erythema.\" Without proper management, it can deteriorate the quality of life of a patient, leading to temporary or definitive stop of chemotherapy. AIM OF THIS STUDY: To identify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients, the risk factors for occurrence and worsening of this syndrome, and the drugs most likely to be responsible of HFS. METHODS: Our study was retrospective, including 42 patients with HFS secondary to a chemotherapy drug. These cases were notified to the National Center of Pharmacovigilance over 7 years. The severity of HFS has been classified according to the NCI-CTCAE v4.0 classification. RESULTS: Our population was composed of 40 women and 2 men. The mean age was 51 years. Docetaxel was the main drug associated with this adverse effect. Hands were involved in all cases and were sometimes associated with other skin surfaces apart from feet. Erythema of the hands and/or feet was present in all patients; it was associated with edema in more than half of the cases. The distribution of different grades according to the NCI-CTCAE classification among the patients was almost equal: 28% Grade 1, 36% Grade 2, and 36% Grade 3. HFS occurred mainly after the first course of chemotherapy with a mean period of 3-4 days. The regression of HFS occurred more rapidly for Grade 1 and Grade 2 compared with Grade 3, especially when assisted by symptomatic treatment. The recurrence rate of HFS for those patients with decreased doses, spacing of cures, and/or symptomatic and prophylaxis treatment was 25%. CONCLUSION: An early detection of HFS, associated with preventive measures, enables patients to continue the chemotherapy.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: To provide a comprehensive literature review of chemotherapy-induced nail toxicity, including clinical presentation, implicated drugs and approaches for prevention and management. DATA SOURCE: A search of MEDLINE and EMBASE (1966-2008) databases was conducted using the terms (and variations of the terms) antineoplastic agents, nails, nail toxicity, onycholysis, and paronychia. Bibliographies from selected articles were reviewed for appropriate references. DATA EXTRACTION: The retrieved literature was reviewed to include all articles relevant to the clinical presentation, diagnosis, incidence, prevention, and treatment of chemotherapy-induced nail toxicity. DATA SYNTHESIS: Nail toxicity is a relatively uncommon adverse effect linked to a number of chemotherapeutic agents. Clinical presentation varies, depending on which nail structure is affected and the severity of the insult. Nail changes may involve all or some nails. Toxicity may be asymptomatic and limited to cosmetic concerns, however, more severe effects, involving pain and discomfort can occur. Taxanes and anthracyclines are the antineoplastic drug groups most commonly implicated. It is suggested that the administration schedule may influence the incidence of nail abnormalities, for example reported cases linked to the weekly administration of paclitaxel.Before instituting chemotherapy, patients should be educated regarding potential nail toxicities and strategies for prevention implemented. Management includes appropriate nail cutting, avoiding potential irritants, topical, or oral antimicrobials, and possibly cessation or dose reduction of the offending agent. Cryotherapy, through the application of frozen gloves or socks, has been beneficial in reducing docetaxel-induced nail toxicity and may be effective for other drugs.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) is overexpressed in up to 30% of breast cancer cases, causing a more aggressive tumour growth and poor prognosis. Trastuzumab, the humanized antibody targeted to HER2, increased the life expectancy of patients, but severe cardiotoxicity emerged as a long-term adverse effect. Clinical evidence highlights that Trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity drastically increases in association with Doxorubicin; however, the exact mechanisms involved remain incompletely understood. In order to analyse the molecular mechanisms involved and the possible adaptative responses to Trastuzumab and Doxorubicin treatment, in this study, H9c2 cardiomyoblasts were used. Results showed that Trastuzumab and Doxorubicin sequential administration in cardiomyoblast increased cytosolic and mitochondrial ROS production, intracellular calcium dysregulation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and the consequent apoptosis, induced by both Trastuzumab and Doxorubicin alone. Furthermore, in these conditions, we observed increased levels of Connexin43 phosphorylated on Ser368 (pCx43). Since phosphorylation on Ser368 decreases gap junction intracellular communication, thus reducing the spread of death signals to adjacent cells, we hypothesized that the increase in pCx43 could be an adaptative response implemented by cells to defend neighbouring cells by Trastuzumab and Doxorubicin sequential administration. However, the other side of the coin is the resulting conduction abnormalities.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, drug and food interactions, dosage and administration, and role in therapy of lapatinib in metastatic breast cancer are reviewed. SUMMARY: Lapatinib is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that dually targets human epidermal growth factor receptors 1 and 2 (HER2). Unlike trastuzumab, lapatinib enters the cell and binds to the intracellular domain of the tyrosine kinase receptor, allowing for complete blockage of the autophosphorylation reaction and a complete halt to the downstream cascade of events. After oral administration, lapatinib reaches peak plasma levels within approximately 4 hours, steady-state levels within six to seven days, and has a half-life of 24 hours. Combination therapy with lapatinib and capecitabine has demonstrated superior time to progression compared with capecitabine monotherapy for the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer refractory to anthracycline-, taxane-, and trastuzumab-containing regimens. Unlike trastuzumab, lapatinib is an orally active agent with promising clinical activity in metastatic breast cancer and is associated with a better adverse-effect profile. The most frequently reported adverse events in patients receiving combination therapy with lapatinib and capecitabine were diarrhea and hand-foot syndrome. Ongoing research has further evaluated the safety of lapatinib regarding cardiac effects and found that the majority of left ventricular ejection fraction decreases from baseline were asymptomatic and reversible. CONCLUSION: Lapatinib has demonstrated efficacy in combination with capecitabine in patients with previously treated HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. In patients with metastatic disease refractory to trastuzumab-, anthracycline-, and taxane-containing regimens, the addition of lapatinib to capecitabine may extend the time to disease progression and progression-free survival.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Head and neck cancers are a heterogeneous group of diseases involving the oral cavity, pharyngeal tube, and larynx. Given the drug therapy options available, clinical pharmacists can play an important role in the care of this patient population. They can recommend a regimen based on efficacy, toxicity, and patient-specific factors; ensure that the prescribed regimen has been studied and reported in the literature; verify dosages; and monitor and counsel patients about adverse effects. Chemotherapy plus radiation (chemoradiation) is often the standard treatment for patients with stage III or nonmetastatic stage IV head and neck cancer. Cisplatin-based regimens are preferred, although carboplatin may be appropriate in some circumstances. Induction therapy with a docetaxel-based regimen is recommended for some patients; however, this therapy has been associated with a high frequency of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. Cetuximab, an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor, is the newest agent approved for treatment of head and neck cancer. Although evidence supports cetuximab combined with cisplatin versus cisplatin alone for patients with metastatic disease, the role of combination therapy is less clear in patients undergoing chemoradiation. Patients with head and neck cancer may experience swallowing difficulties or mouth pain, possibly interfering with drug administration and adherence; thus, pharmacists in all practice settings should be knowledgeable about different regimens and alternative routes of administration. Xerostomia and mucositis are common adverse effects of radiation therapy, and it is critical that good oral hygiene practices are maintained. Patients may achieve symptomatic relief from xerostomia with saliva substitutes, and clinical experience suggests that use of pilocarpine is worthwhile. Until more evidence becomes available, prevention of xerostomia and mucositis with amifostine is still controversial. Salt-water rinses, bioadherent oral gel, and honey are relatively inexpensive and nontoxic agents for managing mucositis. Because of the expense of palifermin, it is best reserved for refractory cases. Skin toxicities are common with radiation. Rash is also a common adverse effect of cetuximab. When used together, they may produce complicated skin toxicities. It is important to become familiar with the grading of these rashes so that appropriate therapy can be recommended. As pharmacotherapy for head and neck cancers continues to evolve, clinical pharmacists will continue to have an important role in optimizing treatment for patients by balancing efficacy and toxicity.',\n",

The overall response rate for docetaxel as a first-line treatment for metastatic breast cancer is 59%. Docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin or vinorelbine has proved particularly effective in the first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Docetaxel is also one of the most active single agents in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), producing an overall response rate of 27% when used as a first-line agent. Docetaxel plus cisplatin was more effective against NSCLC than either drug used alone, yielding response rates of 33-48%. Docetaxel has shown activity against a variety of other tumors, including ovarian cancer (response rate in second-line therapy, 34%), head-and-neck cancer (response rate in first-line therapy, 35%), and soft-tissue sarcoma (response rate in first-line therapy, 32%). The main toxic effect is grade 3-4 neutropenia, which occurs in 57% of treatment cycles but is brief and manageable. The dosage of docetaxel should be reduced from 100 mg/m2 to 75 mg/m2 if patients have neutropenia lasting more than one week, febrile neutropenia, or impaired liver function. Other adverse effects include severe fluid retention and asthenia. Some adverse effects can be avoided by administering corticosteroid premedication. Docetaxel has shown efficacy against a wide range of cancers in clinical trials and has a manageable adverse-effect profile.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common solid tumours and the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Advanced-recurrent HCC often requires a systemic drug therapy where multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Sorafenib represents the first-line therapy option. But it exhibited very limited survival benefit and tumour response due to the early emergence of drug resistance and drug-related adverse effect. Immunotherapy approaches now being widely studied as an effective alternative treatment for HCC. Several immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), such as Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab, are approved as monotherapy in sorafenib-resistant HCC patients. But, the existence of a plethora of immunosuppressive signals in the tumour microenvironment often leads to unsuccessful immunotherapies. In this context, combinatorial immunotherapies are getting much acceptance as a way to improve therapeutic outcomes by blocking immunosuppressive signals in the tumour microenvironment (TME). The combination of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) inhibitors with ICI resulted in significant synergistic effects in various preclinical and clinical studies. However, the adverse effects associated with current synthetic VEGF inhibitors limit its clinical utility. In this review, we have summarized the potential of phytochemicals, especially the category of flavonoids, alkaloids, glycosides, terpenoids, and coumarin, as the available-affordable-safe-effective repositories of VEGF inhibitors. Their possibilities as an alternative for synthetic VEGF inhibitors by synergistic combination with ICI are reviewed, thereby enhancing patient compliance and survival rates. This review highlights the demand for a detailed investigation of the plausible role of plant-based anti-angiogenic-immunotherapy combination against HCC.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Neurologic complications of conventional cytototxic agents as well as those from monoclonal antibodies and targeted therapies are increasingly observed in patients with cancer. The major categories are represented by alkylating agents (platinum compounds, ifosfamide, procarbazine, thiotepa), mitotic spindle inhibitors (vinca alkaloids, taxanes, etoposide, teniposide), proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib), antibiotics, antimetabolites, thalidomide, lenalidomide, topoisomerase inhibitors, interferon-α, hormones, bevacizumab, trastuzumab, and small tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Peripheral neuropathy is a common adverse effect of a number of chemotherapeutic drugs and often represents a critical factor limiting an adequate dose-intensity of chemotherapy. Regarding the central nervous system (CNS), it is vulnerable to many forms of toxicity from chemotherapeutic agents, including encephalopathy syndromes and confusional states, seizures, headache, cerebrovascular complications, visual loss, cerebellar syndromes, and myelopathy. For a given drug, the occurrence of CNS toxicity depends on several factors, including the total dose, route of administration, presence of structural brain lesions, exposure to prior or concurrent irradiation, and interactions with other drugs. However, many of the neurotoxic reactions are rare and idiosyncratic, and remain unpredictable. Several forms of neuroprotection and rehabilitation are being investigated. Last, the so-called \"chemobrain\" is an emerging issue, as it is a model of a subtle of and long-lasting damage to neuronal structures from some antineoplastic agents.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"Introduction: Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is an adverse effect of several classes of chemotherapy including the taxanes. Predictive PN biomarkers could inform individualized taxane treatment to reduce PN and enhance therapeutic outcomes. Pharmacogenetics studies of taxane-induced PN have focused on genes involved in pharmacokinetics, including enzymes and transporters. Contradictory findings from these studies prevent translation of genetic biomarkers into clinical practice. Areas covered: This review discusses the progress toward identifying pharmacogenetic predictors of PN by assessing the evidence for two independent associations; the effect of pharmacogenetics on taxane pharmacokinetics and the evidence that taxane pharmacokinetics affects PN. Assessing these direct relationships allows the reader to understand the progress toward individualized taxane treatment and future research opportunities. Expert opinion: Paclitaxel pharmacokinetics is a major determinant of PN. Additional clinical trials are needed to confirm the clinical benefit of individualized dosing to achieve target paclitaxel exposure. Genetics does not meaningfully contribute to paclitaxel pharmacokinetics and may not be useful to inform dosing. However, genetics may contribute to PN sensitivity and could be useful for estimating patients' optimal paclitaxel exposure. For docetaxel, genetics has not been demonstrated to have a meaningful effect on pharmacokinetics and there is no evidence that pharmacokinetics determines PN.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC)-patients treated with standard chemotherapy experienced progression rapidly. A novel therapy based on programed death 1 (PD-1)/programed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors showed an increasing potential in several malignancies including advanced NSCLC. OBJECTIVES: This article is a meta-analysis aiming to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety profiles of PD-1/PD-L1 agents in patients with NSCLC. DATA SOURCES: Data were collected from eligible studies searched from PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science. SYNTHESIS METHODS: Pooled hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was estimated to assess the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors versus docetaxel, pooled odds ratio (OR) was calculated for objective response rate (ORR). The overall frequency was estimated for 1-year OS, 1-year progression-free survival, and ORR. A subgroup analysis among NSCLC patients tested with different epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) status was also performed to figure out the relationship between EGFR status and efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. OR for occurrence of any grade and grade 3 to 5 treatment-related adverse effect was calculated for evaluating the safety of PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. RESULTS: Nine studies were included in this analysis. The pooled HRs for OS and PFS were 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61-0.75) and 0.83 (95% CI 0.75-0.91), respectively, the pooled OR for ORR was 1.83 (95% CI 1.41-2.36), indicating a significant improvement in OS, PFS, and ORR. In the results of subgroup analysis, the HR for OS in NSCLC patients was 1.05 (95% CI 0.69-1.59) in patients with mutant EGFR and 0.66 (95% CI 0.57-0.77) in patients with wild-type EGFR status. OR for occurrence was 0.36 (95% CI 0.28-0.46) in any grade treatment-related adverse effect and 0.18 (95% CI 0.14-0.22) in grade 3 to 5 treatment-related adverse effect, suggesting a superior safety profile of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. CONCLUSION: The PD-1/PD-L1 therapy significantly prolonged the OS and improved the ORR, simultaneously lowering the treatment-related adverse effect events versus docetaxel.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Although pembrolizumab has shown clinical benefit in patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), its actual efficacy in combination with a conventional chemotherapy drug has not been determined. We performed this study to discern the efficacy and risk of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy as first-line therapy in SCLC patients. METHODS: We systematically searched the PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases for relevant studies. The main outcomes were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: We identified 2980 articles and included 6 studies (5 were noncomparative open-label studies and 1 was a randomized controlled trial [RCT]) involving 396 patients in our meta-analysis. The pooled median OS (mOS) was 9.6 months (95% CI, 8.0-11.2), and the pooled median PFS (mPFS) was 4.2 months (95% CI, 2.2-6.1). The 1-year overall survival rate (OSR-1y) and 6-month progression-free survival rate (PFSR-6m) were 45.1% (95% CI, 33-57.2%) and 41.6% (95% CI, 24.3-59%), respectively. The objective response rate (ORR) was 38.8% (95% CI, 11.9-65.67%), disease control rate (DCR) was 69.30% (95% CI, 51.6-87.0%), complete response (CR) was 2.20% (95% CI, 0.8-3.7%), partial response (PR) was 34.70% (95% CI, 7.8-61.5%), and stable disease (SD) was 20.90% (95% CI, 9.1-32.6%). The grade 3-4 adverse effect (AE) rate was 20.88% (95% CI, 1.22-54.85%). The most common AEs were neutropenia (90.16%), anemia (53.21%), dysphagia (41.96%), platelet count decrease (34.87%), and esophagitis (32.89%); severe AEs included neutropenia, respiratory failure, pneumonitis, acute coronary syndrome, and colitis/intestinal ischemia. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of pembrolizumab with conventional chemotherapy is an effective therapeutic schedule with acceptable and manageable efficacy and toxicity in patients with SCLC. More high-quality and well-designed RCTs with large sample sizes are warranted to further validate our findings.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence and mortality have shown an unfavorable upward trend over the last two decades, especially in developed countries. More than one-sixth of the patients have advanced HCC at presentation. Systemic therapy remains the treatment of choice for these patients. Current options include tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and immunotherapy. This review aims to summarize current knowledge on the rapidly evolving field of systemic therapy with several newly approved medications over the last year. Sorafenib remains one of the first-line treatment choices for patients with hepatitis C etiology, intermediate to advanced HCC stage, and Child-Pugh class A. Lenvatinib is the other first-line drug that might have better efficacy in non-hepatitis C etiologies and advanced HCC without portal vein thrombosis. Patients intolerant to first-line therapy might benefit from immunotherapy with nivolumab or pembrolizumab. In those who fail first-line therapy, the choice should be based on the side effects related to previous treatment, performance status, and underlying liver dysfunction. Ongoing studies are investigating immunotherapy alone or immunotherapy in combination with TKIs as first-line therapy. Several second-line options for combination systemic therapy and systemic plus local-regional treatment are under investigation. Future studies should focus on identifying reliable biomarkers to predict response to therapy and to better stratify patients at high risk for progression. Multidisciplinary approach is pivotal for successful outcomes in patients with advanced HCC.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2/erbB-2) is a member of a family of four transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases that regulate cell growth, survival and differentiation via multiple signal transduction pathways. Amplification of the HER2 gene occurs in 20-25% of human breast cancers. This amplification event is an independent adverse prognostic factor as well as a predictive factor for increased response to doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy, response to trastuzumab and decreased response to hormonal therapy. Methods for detecting protein overexpression or gene amplification in clinical tumor specimens include immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques, with the latter considered by some to be more accurate. Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody which targets an epitope in the extracellular domain of the HER2 protein. Preclinical models demonstrated that this antibody has significant anti-tumor activity as a single agent and has synergy with certain chemotherapeutic drugs. Phase II and III clinical trials performed in women with metastatic breast cancer that overexpress HER2 have shown that trastuzumab has clinical activity when used as first-, second- or third-line monotherapy, and improves survival when used as first-line therapy in combination with chemotherapy. Newer combinations with numerous chemotherapeutic drugs have also shown significant clinical activity in phase II studies. In all of these trials, trastuzumab was generally well-tolerated, but cardiac toxicity (particularly when the antibody was combined with anthracyclines) was an unexpected adverse effect. Although trastuzumab is currently usually administered on a weekly intravenous schedule, evidence suggests that a triple dose of the drug given once every three weeks has a pharmacokinetic profile expected to be equally efficacious. Neither the optimal schedule nor the optimal duration of trastuzumab therapy has yet been clearly defined in controlled clinical trials. Current clinical investigations of trastuzumab include its use in both the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings as well as in combination with other chemotherapy drugs or new biologic targeted agents.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Single-agent activity has been observed for both docetaxel and irinotecan in several solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Compilation of data from phase II trials of single-agent docetaxel therapy in NSCLC yielded overall response rates of 26% and a 1-year survival rate of 52%. Furthermore, a recent study that combined radiotherapy with concurrent docetaxel treatment reported an overall response rate of 77%. The most important adverse effect of docetaxel therapy is neutropenia Phase II trials of single-agent irinotecan for NSCLC patients resulted in response rates of 15% to 31%. The main toxicities were neutropenia and diarrhea. Investigators have begun to explore the efficacy of combining docetaxel and irinotecan. The results of preclinical studies suggest that schedule and order of administration may be important. A Japanese study evaluated the combination in previously untreated patients with NSCLC, and found eight partial responses in 26 patients (32%). A recent phase I study at the Mayo Clinic showed partial responses in three of five patients who received irinotecan followed by docetaxel. In a phase I study conducted at Yale Cancer Center, escalating doses of docetaxel (25 to 40 mg/m2) were given before irinotecan (50 mg/m2) for 4 weeks followed by a 2-week rest. There was one partial response among five evaluable patients with NSCLC (one of four among patients who had received no prior chemotherapy). The results of these studies suggest that the combination of docetaxel and irinotecan shows promise in the treatment of NSCLC. Irinotecan also has been used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. The irinotecan/etoposide combination has been less extensively evaluated but thus far appears to be associated with considerable toxicity, particularly myelosuppression, without clear therapeutic advantage. One report of the use of the triple combination of irinotecan/cisplatin/etoposide resulted in 16 partial responses in 42 NSCLC patients (38%). Like docetaxel, irinotecan has been used effectively in conjunction with radiation therapy, with partial response rates in some studies of more than 70%.',\n",

We present a clinical case of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) secondary to pembrolizumab occurring in a 73-year-old male patient being treated for lung adenocarcinoma, who had received 13 cycles of pembrolizumab. Treatment was immediately stopped and he was treated with high dose steroids to which he responded both clinically and biochemically. There have been prior reports of immunotherapy-associated AIHA with the use of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 inhibitors, such as ipilimumab, but very few reports of programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL-1) inhibitor associated AIHA. We highlight a rare case of AIHA as an adverse effect of pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor. Although unusual, it is important to be vigilant for haematological immune-related adverse events.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'The rapidly expanding repertoire of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) now includes two agents, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab, approved for first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) as monotherapy or as part of chemoimmunotherapy. This review summarizes the clinical evidence supporting these indications, with a focus on strategies to optimize patient outcomes. These strategies include patient and tumor factors, adverse-effect profiles, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug interactions, and quality of life and cost-effectiveness considerations. We performed a systematic literature search of the PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases, as well as a search of the conference proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, European Society for Medical Oncology, and American Association for Cancer Research (through August 31, 2019). The addition of ICIs to conventional chemotherapy as first-line treatment against aNSCLC is now part of the standard of care options. However, even though ICIs may be cost-effective in patients with aNSCLC, high drug and other associated costs can still be a barrier to treatment for patients. Moreover, the adverse-effect profiles of ICIs differ significantly from conventional chemotherapy, and some immune-related adverse effects may have a lasting impact on quality of life. Therefore, in adhering to a patient-centered model of care, clinicians should be mindful of patient- and treatment-specific factors when considering therapeutic options for patients with aNSCLC. Although the role of the immune system in cancer progression and regression has not been fully elucidated, the full clinical potential of immunotherapeutics in the treatment of cancer likely remains to be unleashed.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical trials, adverse effects, and drug interactions of lapatinib. DATA SOURCES: A PubMed search was conducted (1966-August 2005) using the following terms: lapatinib, GW572016, and dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Additional information sources included meeting abstracts, clinical trial data, and bibliographies from articles identified through PubMed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Preclinical and clinical trials that evaluated lapatinib in cell culture, animal models, and human subjects were selected from the data sources. Pivotal in vitro data and all in vivo data published regarding lapatinib were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: The development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors has resulted from a search for targeted cancer therapeutics made possible by recent gains in our understanding of tumor cell biology. Lapatinib is a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor selective for inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 autophosphorylation, leading to suppression of proliferation pathways of solid tumors. Lapatinib has shown clinical activity in solid tumors, with the most notable in advanced or metastatic breast cancer, including tumors refractory to trastuzumab. It has a mild adverse effect profile, with the most common adverse events being diarrhea and rash. CONCLUSIONS: Lapatinib has novel, dual tyrosine kinase inhibitory properties selective for factors overexpressed in some solid tumors. Results from preclinical and Phase I/II trials indicate activity in the treatment of solid tumors, especially advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Application for approval is anticipated pending results of ongoing Phase III trials.',\n",

This was characterized by onycholysis, subungual haemorrhage and acute paronychia, progressing to a subungual abscess of the right index finger. Nail bed hyperaemia and haemosiderin-like nail bed discoloration were present. Nail plate avulsion was performed to decompress the acutely painful subungual abscess. The right thumb, middle finger and left index finger demonstrated early, proximal white subungual collections of pus obscuring the lunula (onychophosis). Central nail plate fenestrations with a surgical drill led to exudation of purulent material. Cultures of the subungual abscess material yielded mixed organisms, possibly related to administration of flucloxacillin for 1 week prior to presentation. The patient completed a further two courses of docetaxel without sequelae, and the nail dystrophy appears to be resolving. Docetaxel-induced nail changes are a common adverse effect, occurring in 30-40% of patients. Mild changes do not usually warrant the discontinuation of treatment.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'First-line treatment based on androgen suppression is initially very effective in relieving the symptoms of metastatic prostate cancer. When androgen suppression no longer controls disease progression and symptoms, which treatments are known to improve duration or quality of survival? To answer this question, we reviewed the evidence using the standard Prescrire methodology. Low doses of corticosteroids, such as prednisone 5 to 10 mg per day, appear to improve quality of life for a few months by relieving symptoms in 20% to 40% of patients. When added to prednisone, docetaxel, a cytotoxic drug, tends to be more effective than mitoxantrone in terms of pain relief and quality of life. Docetaxel prolongs survival by about 2 months but provokes severe adverse effects in one-quarter of patients. Adding estramustine to this combination prolongs survival but carries a risk of serious thromboembolic events. Addition of bevacizumab has no proven impact on survival. After failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy with docetaxel, two hormonal treatments, abiraterone and enzalutamide, appear to prolong survival by about 4 or 5 months, and are associated with moderate adverse effects. However, these results are based on only one trial of each drug. Cabazitaxel is also moderately effective in terms of survival but has a less favourable adverse effect profile than abiraterone. A meta-analysis of trials of bisphosphonates used to prevent complications of bone metastases showed no major benefit, including in terms of pain relief. Bisphosphonates are not sufficiently effective to justify exposing patients to their potentially serious adverse effects. In one trial, the harm-benefit balance of denosumab was no better than that of zoledronic acid, a bisphosphonate. External beam radiation therapy or intravenous infusion of strontium-89 (a radioisotope) each relieves pain associated with bone metastases in over 70% of cases. If metastatic prostate cancer progresses despite androgen suppression, the two main options in 2012 are either: palliative treatment with corticosteroids and external beam radiation therapy or radioisotope infusion; or docetaxel followed by abiraterone, which slightly prolongs survival but at a cost of sometimes serious adverse effects.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: The aim of our study was to assess the clinical features of hand-foot syndrome (HFS) associated with certain systemic chemotherapeutic drugs in a real-world setting using the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database. METHODS: HFS was defined using the preferred terms from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. We used several indices, such as the reporting odds ratios (RORs) at 95% confidence interval (CI), the time-to-onset profile of HFS, and cluster analysis. RESULTS: Of 646,779 reports (submission period: April 2004 to September 2020), 1814 reported HFS events. The RORs (95% CI) for axitinib, capecitabine, lapatinib, regorafenib, sorafenib, and sunitinib were 14.9 (11.1-20.1), 54.6 (49.2-60.6), 130.4 (110.7-153.6), 63.3 (55.2-72.6), 29.0 (25.8-32.7), and 13.9 (11.7-16.5), respectively. The analysis of time-to-onset profiles revealed that the median values (interquartile range: 25.0-75.0%) of drug-induced HFS caused by capecitabine, cisplatin, docetaxel, everolimus, regorafenib, sorafenib, and trastuzumab were 21.0 (13.0-42.0), 15.0 (10.0-82.0), 6.0 (3.0-25.0), 86.5 (67.0-90.5), 9.0 (6.0-14.0), 9.0 (6.0-14.0), and 70.0 (15.0-189.0) days, respectively. The number of clusters was set to 4. Among these, one cluster, which included capecitabine, regorafenib, and lapatinib, exhibited a higher reporting ratio and ROR of drug-induced HFS than other drugs. CONCLUSIONS: The RORs and results of time-to-onset analysis obtained in this study indicated the potential risk of HFS associated with chemotherapeutic drugs. Our results suggest that health care professionals must be aware of the potential onset of drug-induced HFS with docetaxel, regorafenib, and sorafenib for at least 4\\u2009weeks; therefore, careful observation is recommended. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Elucidation of the relationship between cancer drugs and risk of hand-foot syndrome: Purpose: Hand-foot syndrome (HFS) is an adverse effect of some cancer drugs, which is characterized by symptoms such as redness, swelling, blistering, and pain in the area of palms and soles. HFS reduces the quality of life of patients and can sometimes interfere with anticancer treatment plans. It is important to understand the clinical manifestations of HFS and gain knowledge that will allow for early intervention by clinicians.Methods: In this study, we used a large-scale side effect database of real-world cases for a comprehensive investigation of anticancer-drug-induced HFS. The database contained 646,779 adverse event reports from April 2004 to September 2020; among which, we identified 1814 HFS events. Using these data, we could obtain information on the relationship between 19 types of anticancer drugs and HFS, and the onset time of HFS and HFS prognosis related to each anticancer drug. Results: Our results suggest that clinicians should monitor the risk of HFS with docetaxel, regorafenib, and sorafenib for at least the first 4 weeks after drug administration. Conclusion: These findings are crucial for improving the management of the adverse effects caused by anticancer drugs.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical and economic study data for docetaxel, paclitaxel and vinorelbine in the treatment of anthracycline-resistant advanced breast cancer. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A Markov decision-analysis model to simulate the clinical course of a 'typical' patient with advanced breast cancer during salvage chemotherapy was updated with response rates and adverse effect rates from phase III clinical trial data for docetaxel, paclitaxel and vinorelbine. Costs were taken from UK national databases and hospitals. Utilities were estimated from 30 oncology nurses in the UK using the standard gamble method. PERSPECTIVE: National Health Service. RESULTS: When compared with other chemotherapeutic agents, docetaxel has been shown to increase response rate, time to progression and survival in patients with advanced breast cancer. In the base-case analysis, the incremental cost-utility ratio for docetaxel versus paclitaxel was pound1995 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained (1998 values). The incremental cost-utility ratio for docetaxel versus vinorelbine was pound14 055 per QALY gained. In the comparison with vinorelbine, docetaxel provided the equivalent of an additional 92 days of perfect health. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the model and the validity of the base-case analysis results. Even in the worst case scenarios, docetaxel remained cost effective compared with paclitaxel and vinorelbine. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the use of the taxoids, notably docetaxel, in the management of advanced breast cancer.\",\n",

Accumulating evidence from clinical studies, particularly the latest results from the phase III comparative SCOTROC study, indicates that the two drugs confer similar rates of tumour response and survival in women with this condition. However, it is clear that paclitaxel and docetaxel differ in their tolerability profiles and in other respects, and cannot be regarded as directly equivalent drugs. In particular, paclitaxel is associated with significant neurotoxicity; peripheral neuropathy has also been reported with docetaxel, but to a lesser extent. Neutropenia appears more prevalent with docetaxel than with paclitaxel, although clinical trial data show that this adverse effect is manageable and need not compromise dose delivery. Docetaxel is also associated with potential benefits accruing from shorter infusion times and lack of need for premedication with intravenous histamine H(1) and H(2) antagonists. Emerging quality of life data are expected to shed further light on the overall benefit of chemotherapy in women with advanced ovarian cancer in general, and on taxane-platinum combinations in particular.',\n",

The aims of these studies were to determine the optimal dosage schedule of docetaxel for use in subsequent phase II studies, and to characterise the pharmacokinetic and tolerability profiles of docetaxel. Intravenous (i.v.) doses of docetaxel (5-115 mg/m2) were administered in various treatment schedules for a total of 790 courses. Cycles were repeated every 2-3 weeks. Dose-dependent neutropenia was the major dose-limiting adverse effect of docetaxel. Other adverse events reported included hypersensitivity, fluid retention, skin reactions, asthenia and alopecia. Anaphylactoid reactions occurred rarely. No abnormal cardiac activity was detected, and neurological adverse events were mild. Docetaxel 100 mg/m2 administered as a 1 h i.v. infusion every 3 weeks combined acceptable tolerability with complete neutropenic recovery. This dosage schedule was thus considered to be optimal for further investigation in phase II studies.',\n",

This chemotherapeutic cardiotoxicity is potentially life-threatening and necessitates limiting or discontinuing an otherwise-effective cancer treatment. Clinical strategies focus on surveillance rather than prevention, although there are no specific therapies for this highly morbid adverse effect. Current models for prospectively predicting risk of chemotherapeutic cardiotoxicity are limited. Cardiotoxicity can occur idiosyncratically in patients without obvious demographic risk factors, suggesting a genetically determined susceptibility, and candidate-gene studies have identified a limited number of variants that increase risk. In this commentary we indicate a need for more powerful means to identify risk prospectively, and suggest that broad pharmacogenomic approaches may be fruitful.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVE: To review the chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of neratinib in human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2)+ breast cancer (BC). DATA SOURCES: A PubMed search was performed using the term neratinib between September 12, 2018, and November 21, 2018. References of published articles and reviews were also assessed for additional information. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: English-language preclinical and clinical studies on the chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of neratinib were evaluated. DATA SYNTHESIS: Neratinib, an irreversible inhibitor of HER1, HER2, and HER4, is Food and Drug Administration approved for the extended adjuvant treatment of stage I-III HER2+ BC to follow trastuzumab-based therapy. A phase III study has demonstrated statistically significant improvement in 5-year disease-free survival rate (90.2 vs 87.7; hazard ratio = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.57-0.92, P = 0.0083). Its most common adverse effect is diarrhea, observed in more than 90% of patients. The incidence of grade 3/4 diarrhea (~40%) is reduced by half with loperamide prophylaxis, which is recommended for the first 8 weeks of neratinib therapy. Other common adverse reactions are nausea and fatigue. The patients need to be monitored for liver function tests and drug interactions with acid-reducing agents, CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers, and P-glycoprotein substrates with narrow therapeutic window. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: American Society of Clinical Oncology and National Comprehensive Cancer Network clinical guidelines suggest the use of neratinib for extended adjuvant therapy following 1-year trastuzumab in stage I to III HER2+ BC. Diarrhea remains a clinically significant but manageable adverse event. CONCLUSION: Neratinib significantly improves treatment outcomes and has manageable toxicity in stage I to III HER2+ BC patients.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Proteinuria is a dose-limiting adverse effect of ramucirumab treatment, which is an anti-angiogenic agent that targets the human vascular endothelial growth factor. The predictors of proteinuria have not been completely elucidated and there is currently no consensus. The present study aimed to identify the risk factors for ramucirumab-induced proteinuria and to determine an optimal proteinuria management. A total of 145 patients who received ramucirumab at Ogaki Municipal Hospital (Ogaki, Japan) between September 2015 and March 2021 were retrospectively studied. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the association between the patient baseline characteristics and the development of proteinuria following ramucirumab treatment. Furthermore, the time of proteinuria onset and of the worst qualitative proteinuria were recorded. Proteinuria (>2+) following ramucirumab was independently associated with lung cancer [odd ratio (OR): 0.232, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.061-0.874; P=0.031] and proteinuria at the start of treatment [qualitative test (+/-); OR: 4.760, 95% CI: 1.360-16.700; P=0.041]. The median time of onset of proteinuria was 56 days (time range, 7-414 days), and the median time when the worst qualitative results were observed was 83 days (time range, 7-442 days). The >2+ proteinuria in the qualitative test was observed in 27 out of the 82 patients with gastric cancer (P=0.041), 8/21 patients with colon cancer (P=0.188), and in 3 out of the 37 patients with lung cancer (P=0.003). The prevalence of proteinuria was low in patients with lung cancer, and proteinuria (>2+) was likely to occur when the proteinuria at the start of ramucirumab was (+/-) by qualitative test. The results from the present study indicated that particular attention should be paid to proteinuria at the start of treatment when monitoring proteinuria as an adverse event of ramucirumab treatment.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Enzalutamide is a second-generation androgen receptor signaling inhibitor that was approved by the US FDA in 2012 for the treatment of metastatic docetaxel-pretreated castrate-resistant prostate cancer. In preclinical studies, enzalutamide demonstrated higher affinity to the androgen receptor compared with the first-generation androgen receptor inhibitors. In the well-designed Phase III AFFIRM study, enzalutamide treatment showed improved overall survival compared with placebo in addition to improvement of all preplanned secondary parameters. Overall, enzalutamide seemed to be very well tolerated with a favorable side-effect profile, with a lower incidence of grade 3-4 adverse events. A potentially concerning adverse effect was the occurrence of seizures that were reported in approximately 1% of the patients receiving enzalutamide (compared with 0% in the placebo arm). This review will summarize the mechanism of action of enzalutamide, the preclinical and clinical development that led to its approval focusing on the AFFIRM trial results, its safety and efficacy and the ongoing trials, as well as patterns of resistance to this drug in the context of five new drugs approved for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. With a changing landscape for these patients, treatment sequencing and best treatment for individual patients remains challenging.',\n",

Cardiotoxicity is a serious adverse effect. A decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) occurs in as many as 27% of women treated with trastuzumab when combined with standard chemotherapy. The pathophysiology of this effect, which differs from the cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines, remains poorly understood. While overt heart failure is reversed with standard therapy, the longer-term consequences of asymptomatic declines in LVEF remain unknown. Monitoring 3-monthly for 5-10% changes in LVEF, the criteria for cessation of trastuzumab therapy in the clinical trials, is not possible for the population of women who might benefit from trastuzumab for early breast cancer. Extension of this therapy to an older and less fit population than those enrolled in the trials, with less rigorous cardiac screening, may result in significantly more cardiotoxicity.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Introduction: Immunotherapy is a treatment option for non-small cell lung cancer advanced disease. However; immunotherapy in several patients induces orogonitis and effusion in different cavities. It is up to the treating physician to understand whether there is effusion due to adverse effect or disease progression. Pleurodesis in both cases might be a solution for recurrent pleura effusion. Patients and Methods: Three hundred and thirty seven non-small cell lung cancer patients with adenocarcinoma and pleura effusion during first line immunotherapy treatment underwent medical thoracoscopy or Video assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for pleurodesis with talk poudrage. Uniportal medical thoracoscopy was performed under general with dual channel endotracheal tube in one hundred and eleven patients. Video assisted thoracic surgery was performed in one hundred and eighty seven patients and conversion from medical to VATS procedure was done to thirty nine patients. All patients had stage IV disease with pleura involvement and were under first line pembrolizumab treatment with 200mg (PD-L1 ≥ 50%). Results: The quantitative parameters of the study (expression, PY and cycle) were converted to an ordinal scale to facilitate the performance of statistical analysis. All parameters were examined as dependent against the parameter technique acting as independent to detect potential relationships. The results of multi Y versus X relationship revealed no statistically significant effect (p>0.05) of the three levels of technique against any response considered. Thus we can infer, quite safely, that the innovative operation (level 0) does not differ from the other two conventional methods (levels 2 and 3) through all parameters entered in the model. There was no significant difference between the different pleurodesis techniques. Discussion: Immunotherapy is known to induce in a number of patients pleura effusion and pericarditis. However; pleurodesis is efficient when the appropriate method is performed to every patient. Careful assessment in a case by case manner has to be performed for each patient before any procedure is performed.',\n",

To improve the chemotherapeutic efficacy of DTX and reduce adverse effects, combination therapy is one of the alternative methods. So chrysin, which has various biological activities including anticancer effects, was considered. In vitro, the combination of chrysin and DTX was investigated in A549 cells. Increased cytotoxicity, suppressed cellular proliferation, and induced apoptosis were observed with posttreatment of chrysin following DTX treatment. In vivo, chrysin enhanced the tumor growth delay of DTX and increased DTX-induced apoptosis in the A549-derived xenograft model. Furthermore, chrysin prevented DTX-induced edema in ICR mouse. These results indicated that chrysin strengthened the therapeutic efficacy of DTX and diminished the adverse effect of DTX, suggesting chrysin could be exploited as an adjuvant therapy for NSCLC.',\n",

The cause of this adverse effect has to do with their mechanism of action against microtubules and its interaction with neuronal cytoskeletal components. The variability of this toxicity is defined by several factors including disease type, taxane class, schedule and dose of the specific drug, patient demographics, and use of taxanes in combination regimens (especially with the platinums that are also neurotoxic). Prevention of life-long neuropathy is only produced if the causative drug is halted--treatments to reverse toxicity have shown only minimal improvement. This review investigates trials defining the clinical factors that determine the therapeutic window of taxanes and the enhanced susceptibility to this toxicity.

       "  'AB': 'Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) subtype of breast cancer is aggressive, leading to a poor outcome. Targeted therapy with trastuzumab has been shown to be effective in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. Cardiotoxicity is a specific adverse effect associated with trastuzumab. The initial formulation of trastuzumab was intravenous, but presently, a subcutaneous formulation (Herceptin SC) is available. Insufficient data on the response rate and cardiotoxic effects of trastuzumab among indigenous Black populations exist. In all studies evaluating the efficacy and toxicity of trastuzumab alone or in combination with chemotherapy, indigenous Black populations in Africa were not included, yet they are the ones most likely to benefit from highly effective cancer medicines. This is partly due to poor oncology clinical trial infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa. The ARETTA study protocol (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03879577) is a phase II multicenter feasibility study to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of docetaxel given every 3 weeks for 4 cycles plus trastuzumab in 60 previously untreated women with nonmetastatic breast cancer. The primary endpoint is to assess the proportion of patients with complete pathologic response. Secondary endpoints include the number of patients who require dose delays in docetaxel and trastuzumab attributed to hematologic, GI, and cardiac toxicity. Pharmacokinetic profiles of subcutaneous trastuzumab will also be determined. The ARETTA study will provide important information on the clinical response and cardiac safety of subcutaneous trastuzumab in combination with docetaxel among indigenous African women with nonmetastatic breast cancer. It can also be used as a blueprint for conducting biomarker-driven oncology clinical trials in low-resource settings such as sub-Saharan Africa.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Microtubule-stabilizing agents (MTSAs), including the taxanes and epothilones, are effective chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of many cancers. Neuropathy is a major adverse effect of MTSA-based chemotherapy, with severe peripheral neuropathy (grade 3 or 4) occurring in as many as 30% of patients treated with a MTSA. MTSA-induced neuropathy usually resolves gradually after cessation of the treatment. The most reliable method to accurately assess MTSA-induced neuropathy is by clinical evaluation, although additional techniques are being developed and evaluated. Among MTSA-induced neuropathy, the most extensively studied is that induced by taxanes; such a neuropathy usually presents as sensory neuropathy and is more common with paclitaxel than docetaxel. The incidence of MTSA-induced neuropathy seems to depend on the MTSA dose per treatment cycle, the schedule of treatment, and the duration of the infusion. Although there have been several small clinical trials with neuroprotective agents, early recognition and supportive care are the best approaches for prevention and management of MTSA-induced neuropathy. In the future, research should focus on elucidating the mechanism of MTSA-induced neuropathy, developing reliable in vivo and in vitro preclinical models to study MTSA-induced neuropathy, developing a more reliable grading system for MTSA-induced neuropathy, developing more reliable methods for evaluating MTSA-induced neuropathy, and evaluating the efficacy of potential neuroprotective agents in clinical trials.',\n",

Inhibition of PD-1 also inhibits T-cell peripheral tolerance, enhancing autoimmunity. Various autoimmune conditions have been reported with the use of these agents, including type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). This article reviews literature regarding the development of T1DM in patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors and identifies strategies for the appropriate identification, monitoring, and follow-up of these patients. Published cases of T1DM related to PD-1 inhibitor therapy were identified using PubMed. Eighty-three identified publications were reviewed, of which 37 publications involving 42 cases of anti-PD-1 therapy-induced T1DM were identified. The average age of patients at presentation was 62 years and 59.5% were male. The mean number of PD-1 inhibitor doses received was 5, with a mean time to presentation of 11 weeks. Initial presentation of diabetic ketoacidosis was reported in 69% of cases, with an average blood glucose of 660 mg/dL and an average HbA(1c) of 8.7%. The exact mechanism PD-1 inhibitor therapy-induced T1DM is unknown. Blood glucose monitoring is recommended for all patients receiving anti-PD-1 therapy. Further research is needed to delineate the frequency of this adverse effect, as well as to evaluate potential risk factors and ideal management strategies.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: As taxanes are increasingly used in oncology, the myalgia-arthralgia syndrome (M-AS) that represents an adverse effect of these drugs is becoming more common. Nevertheless, information regarding predisposing factors, prevention, and therapy of the syndrome is still lacking. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women who had received docetaxel as part of the FEC-D(T) regimen for the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer were retrospectively identified from the records of our oncology department. Data on demographics, disease specifics, adverse effects, and treatment were reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups: those who developed M-AS after docetaxel treatment and those who did not develop the syndrome. The two groups were compared to identify risk factors for M-AS. Effectiveness of drugs used for M-AS was evaluated. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients were identified as fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Nineteen patients developed the M-AS after the first docetaxel administration. Forty-eight patients did not develop the syndrome. Three patients in this group were excluded because they had been taking gabapentin or pregabalin at the time of docetaxel administration for another indication. The remaining 45 patients constituted the control group. The two groups were similar in age, menopause status, stage of their cancer, and histology. The M-AS group had a higher median body surface area and was more likely to receive less than the three intended cycles of docetaxel. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, atypical antiepileptics, extended corticosteroids, and opioids were drugs used as M-AS treatments. CONCLUSION: Docetaxel-associated M-AS is an adverse effect causing incomplete drug treatment. Possible risk factors and effectiveness of treatments for the syndrome are presented.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical literature supporting reduced doses of dexamethasone to prevent taxane hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs), and edema/skin toxicities in respect to docetaxel, when taxanes are given weekly, as opposed to every 3 weeks. DATA SOURCE: Clinical literature of human-controlled clinical trials, accessed through MEDLINE and meeting abstract databases (from 1990 to 2010). DATA EXTRACTION: The retrieved literature was reviewed to include all human clinical trials that recorded adverse effect information with weekly taxanes utilizing reduced-dose or tapering dexamethasone schemas, either prospectively or retrospectively. DATA SYNTHESIS: Prophylaxis for paclitaxel-related HSRs generally includes one or more 20 mg doses of dexamethasone, with histamine-1 and -2 receptor antagonists prior to infusion of paclitaxel. Prophylaxis for docetaxel-related HSRs generally includes dexamethasone beginning 1 day before docetaxel, and continuing twice daily for a total of 3 days. These schedules were designed for taxanes given every 3 weeks, but may lead to steroid-related adverse effects when given weekly with weekly taxane administration. Treatment strategies designed to reduce corticosteroid exposure in patients receiving weekly taxanes have been investigated. CONCLUSIONS: Several predication strategies utilizing reduced doses of dexamethasone with weekly taxanes appear to be feasible and safe, and can be considered for patients experiencing, or at high risk for steroid-induced side effects. However, the optimal schedule is not yet determined; larger prospective clinical trials are needed.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'The tyrosine kinase receptor erbB2, also known in humans as Her2, is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR or erbB1) family, which also includes erbB3 and erbB4. The erbBs were discovered in an avian erythroblastosis tumor virus and exhibited similarities to human EGFR (Yarden and Sliwkowski, 2001). Her2/erbB2 is highly expressed in many cancer types. Its overexpression is correlated with a poor prognosis for breast and ovarian cancer patients. ErbB receptors bind to a family of growth factors, termed neuregulins/heregulin (NRG/HRG), which comprise NRG-1, -2, -3, and -4 and include multiple isoforms. ErbB2/Her2 is an orphan receptor that does not bind ligand alone but heterodimerizes with the other erbB receptors for NRG signaling. ErbB2 is expressed in multiple neuronal and non-neuronal tissues in embryos and adult animals, including the heart. Genetic data demonstrated that erbB2 is required for normal embryonic development of neural crest-derived cranial sensory neurons. ErbB2/Her2-null mutant embryos of a trabeculation defect die before embryonic day (E) 11. To study its role at later stages of development, we generated a transgenic mouse line that specifically expresses the rat erbB2 cDNA in the heart under the control of the cardiac-specific alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter. When crossed into the null background, the expression of the rat erbB2 cDNA rescued the cardiac phenotype in the erbB2-null mutant mice that survive until birth but display an absence of Schwann cells and a severe loss of both motor and spinal sensory neurons. To study the role of erbB2 in the adult heart, we generated conditional mutant mice carrying a cardiac-restricted deletion of erbB2. These erbB2 conditional mutants exhibited multiple independent parameters of dilated cardiomyopathy, including chamber dilation, wall thinning, and decreased contractility. Interestingly, treatment of breast cancers overexpressing erbB2 with Herceptin (Trastuzumab), a humanized monoclonal antibody specific to the extracellular domain of erbB2, results in some patients developing cardiac dysfunction. The adverse effect is increased significantly in those patients who also receive the chemotherapeutical agent anthracycline. We found that erbB2-deficient cardiac myocytes are more susceptible to anthracycline-induced cytotoxicity. These results suggest that erbB2 signaling in the heart is essential for the prevention of dilated cardiomyopathy. These lines of mice provide models with which to elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which erbB2 signaling regulates cardiac functions. These mice also will provide important information for devising strategies to mitigate the cardiotoxic effects of Herceptin treatment, allowing for the potential expanded use of this drug to treat all cancers overexpressing erbB2.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes current HER2-targeted therapies and clinical studies that have investigated primary and secondary prevention of cardiac dysfunction for HER2\\u2009+\\u2009breast cancer patients undergoing targeted therapy. RECENT FINDINGS: Primary and secondary prevention clinical trials highlight the importance of cardioprotective measures during HER2\\u2009+\\u2009cancer treatment. Together, these studies suggest the safety of neurohormonal drugs, the importance for an individualized approach in starting cardiopreventive therapies, and the potential to expand HER2\\u2009+\\u2009treatment options to patients with cardiac dysfunction. Cardiac dysfunction is a concerning adverse effect for HER2-targeted treatment. The goal of primary and secondary prevention is to prevent (further) cardiac function decline and heart failure symptoms, while delivering appropriate cancer therapy. Clinical trials investigating preventative therapies in the context of primary and secondary prevention are paving the path for reducing adverse cardiac effects and expanding treatment options for patients previously unable to undergo HER\\u2009+\\u2009therapy.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'The recognition that early breast cancer is a systemic disease has led to the development of multimodal treatments incorporating adjuvant hormonal and chemotherapies. Adjuvant strategies have improved the outcome of treatment for early breast cancer, but 50% of women still relapse and develop overt metastatic disease, which is largely incurable. In the search for more effective chemotherapies, the taxoid, docetaxel (Taxotere; Rhône-Poulenc Rorer, Antony, France), has demonstrated high single-agent activity against metastatic breast cancer, including visceral metastases, and is now in phase III trials of combination adjuvant and front-line therapies. When cytotoxic drugs are used in combination, it is important to consider the dose-response relationships and the toxicity profiles of the agents involved. It often is necessary to reduce the doses of drugs given in combination to avoid excessive toxicity; this may result in the administration of suboptimal doses. Early clinical studies have shown that therapeutic doses of docetaxel (60 to 100 mg/m2) can be used in combinations with doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, vinorelbine, and cisplatin. The most frequent adverse effect of docetaxel is neutropenia (91% of patients), but other effects, such as neurosensory changes and fluid retention, also must be taken into consideration when planning combination therapies. It may be possible to ameliorate some toxicities by preventive measures. Fluid retention, which generally occurs at cumulative doses greater than 500 mg/m2, has been shown to be reduced in severity and delayed in onset by prophylactic corticosteroid treatment from the day before each docetaxel administration for 3 to 5 days. Neutropenia may be reduced by treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and neurotoxicity may be reduced by protectants such as amifostine. These strategies are under investigation. The high single-agent activity of docetaxel makes it an excellent candidate for treatments such as induction regimens before high-dose chemotherapy and adjuvant therapies. Short-term treatment regimens such as these should also avoid the cumulative toxicities of docetaxel. It is important that new drugs, such as docetaxel, which have shown promising activity against metastatic disease and could have a significant impact on the natural history of early breast cancer, are investigated as front-line treatments.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer is a distinct subset of breast cancer that results from overexpression of HER2 protein. Pertuzumab-a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the extracellular dimerization domain II of HER2-was recently approved for adjuvant therapy and neoadjuvant therapy of HER2-positive early breast cancer. As pertuzumab and trastuzumab bind to different domains of the extracellular dimerization domain of HER2, a combination therapy of pertuzumab and trastuzumab is beneficial for the treatment of metastatic cancer, advanced local cancer, or early cancer by dual HER2 blockage. Many clinical trials have been performed using pertuzumab for breast cancer patients; these include the CLEOPATRA trial for palliative therapy, the APHINITY trial for adjuvant therapy, and the NeoSphere and the TRYPHAENA trials for neoadjuvant therapy. These trials revealed pertuzumab to be a safe and effective drug regardless of the patient age and hormone receptor status. Notably, pertuzumab use was associated with severe cardiac toxicity in some cases; however, the risk of pertuzumab-induced cardiac dysfunction was low. The most common adverse effect associated with pertuzumab-use was diarrhea, but most cases were not severe. Several different chemotherapeutic agents have been investigated to determine optimal chemotherapeutic combinations for dual HER2 blockage. Some exploratory analyses indicate that pertuzumab treatment offered little benefit to patients with node-negative and small primary tumors; pertuzumab treatment was also found not be cost-effective. Further research will reveal the appropriate usage of pertuzumab for treating a subset of eligible patients.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dexamethasone pretreatment regimen with different doses in the prevention of docetaxel-induced hypersensitivity reaction (HSR). One hundred and sixty-two patients who had malignant tumors as determined by histology and/or cytology and received docetaxel treatments at least 2 cycles, were randomized into two groups. There were 90 patients in the study group and 72 patients in the control group. In the study group, patients received 4.5mg of oral dexamethasone once a day. Patients in the control group received 8 mg of dexamethasone twice a day. All patients received dexamethasone for 3 days, from the day before docetaxel treatment to the day after docetaxel treatment. The endpoints were hypersensitivity reaction (HSR) and other adverse effects, which were determined according to common terminology criteria for adverse event v3.0 (CTCAE 3.0). In the study group, 10 patients had HSRs (11.1%). While in the control group, 7 patients had HSRs (9.7%), and the main clinical symptoms of HSR were rash (3.1%), fever/chill (2.5%), angioedema (1.9%), chest discomfort (1.9%) and hypotension (0.6%). There was no statistically significant difference between these two groups (P=0.774). There was no significant difference in the incidence rate of adverse effect between patients in the study group and in the control group. Those adverse effects included neutropenia, decreased hemoglobin, nausea, vomiting, fatigue and fluid retention. Since no significant difference in the HSR incidence between these two groups has been found, 4.5mg of dexamethasone (qd) is as efficient and safe as 8mg (bid).',\n",

       "  'AB': 'INTRODUCTION: In the REFLECT trial, lenvatinib was found to be noninferior compared to sorafenib in terms of overall survival. Here, we analyze the effects of lenvatinib in the real-life experience of several centers across the world and identify clinical factors that could be significantly associated with survival outcomes. METHODS: The study population was derived from retrospectively collected data of HCC patients treated with lenvatinib. The overall cohort included western and eastern populations from 23 center in five countries. RESULTS: We included 1,325 patients with HCC and treated with lenvatinib in our analysis. Median OS was 16.1 months. Overall response rate was 38.5%. Multivariate analysis for OS highlighted that HBsAg positive, NLR >3, and AST >38 were independently associated with poor prognosis in all models. Conversely, NAFLD/NASH-related etiology was independently associated with good prognosis. Median progression-free survival was 6.3 months. Multivariate analysis for progression-free survival revealed that NAFLD/NASH, BCLC, NLR, and AST were independent prognostic factors for progression-free survival. A proportion of 75.2% of patients suffered from at least one adverse effect during the study period. Multivariate analysis exhibited the appearance of decreased appetite grade ≥2 versus grade 0-1 as an independent prognostic factor for worse progression-free survival. 924 patients of 1,325 progressed during lenvatinib (69.7%), and 827 of them had a follow-up over 2 months from the beginning of second-line treatment. From first-line therapy, the longest median OS was obtained with the sequence lenvatinib and immunotherapy (47.0 months), followed by TACE (24.7 months), ramucirumab (21.2 months), sorafenib (15.7 months), regorafenib (12.7 months), and best supportive care (10.8 months). CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms in a large and global population of patients with advanced HCC, not candidates for locoregional treatment the OS reported in the registration study and a high response rate with lenvatinib.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: The aim of this phase II study was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of docetaxel and irinotecan combination chemotherapy in patients with ovarian cancer refractory and resistant to both platinum and taxan treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients who had been treated with platinum and paclitaxel but whose ovarian cancer progressed or recurred within 6 months of treatment (n = 41) received docetaxel 60 mg/m(2) (day 1) and irinotecan 60 mg/m(2) (days 1, 8), repeated every 21 days [Japan Gynecologic Oncology Group (JGOG) study 3015] or every 28 days [West Japan Gynecologic Oncology Group (WJGOG) study 002] until disease progression was observed or unacceptable toxicity. Sixteen patients had platinum/paclitaxel-refractory disease, and 25 patients had platinum/paclitaxel-resistant disease. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were available for determination of the clinical response. The overall response rate [complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)] was 6.3%, and the disease control rate (CR + PR + stable disease) was 34.4%. Among the 23 patients with resistant tumor, the disease control rate was 47.8%. Ten patients with refractory tumor showed a 10% disease control rate. The median progression-free interval was 12.1 weeks and the median overall survival time was 45.3 weeks. The major toxic adverse effect was neutropenia (grade 4, 56.1%), but the incidence of neutropenic fever was less frequent (4.9%). Neurotoxicity and gastro-intestinal toxicity were mild. CONCLUSION: Among our patients, a combination of docetaxel and irinotecan was well tolerated. However, this combination may not be a beneficial option for patients with platinum-refractory and -resistant ovarian cancer in terms of response rate and survival.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: The combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel (GT) has been demonstrated to be effective against various types of solid tumors, including sarcoma. However, the regimen has not been confirmed in large, well-designed clinical trials in refractory metastatic osteosarcoma. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients with refractory metastatic osteosarcoma at Peking University People's Hospital who were treated with gemcitabine (1000\\xa0mg/m(2)) intravenously (IV) on Day 1 and Day 8, and docetaxel (75\\xa0mg/m(2)) IV on Day 8, repeated every 21\\xa0days. RESULTS: A total of 52 patients with a median age of 18.4\\xa0years were treated with GT at the Peking University People's Hospital from August 2012 to August 2017. A total of 174 courses were administered. Only five patients with pulmonary metastasis achieved a best response of stable disease (SD), while all other patients had progressive disease. The result was disappointing with an ORR of 0%, a DCR of 9.6%, and a median DOR of 3.5\\xa0months. Grade 3 or 4 toxicities were observed in 69 (39.7%) courses and in 28 (53.8%) patients, most of which were myelosuppression, especially thrombocytopenia. No fatal adverse effect (AE) was found. CONCLUSION: The combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel (GT) as a salvage regimen is well-tolerated but not as effective as expected in refractory metastatic osteosarcoma. This report highlights the need for the development of new approaches with higher activity in these patients.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'Monoclonal antibodies including trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and antibody-drug conjugates, form the backbone of HER2-positive breast cancer therapy. Unfortunately, an important adverse effect of these agents is cardiotoxicity, occurring in approximately 10% of patients. There is increasing published data regarding prevention strategies for cardiotoxicity, though seldom used in clinical practice. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials to evaluate pharmacotherapy for the prevention of monoclonal HER2-directed antibody-induced cardiotoxicity in patients with breast cancer. Online databases were queried from their inception until October 2021. Effects were determined by calculating risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) or mean differences (MD) using random-effects models. We identified five eligible trials. In the three trials (n = 952) reporting data on the primary outcome of cardiotoxicity, there was no clear effect for patients assigned active treatment compared to control (RR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.29, p = 0.57). Effects were similar for ACE-I/ARB and beta-blockers (p homogeneity = 0.50). Active treatment reduced the risk of HER2 therapy interruptions (RR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.77, p < 0.001) with similar findings for ACE-I/ARB and beta-blockers (p homogeneity = 0.97). Prophylactic treatment with ACE-I/ARB or beta-blocker therapy may be of value for cardio-protection in patients with breast cancer prescribed monoclonal antibodies. Further, adequately powered randomized trials are required to define the role of routine prophylactic treatment in this patient group.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"Immune checkpoint inhibitors are new targeted treatments that harness the body's immune system to attack cancers. Drugs that are most extensively used among checkpoint inhibitors inhibit the PD-L1 or PD-1 (programmed death 1) ligand or receptor pair and are currently approved for many cancer indications. In gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas one inhibitor, pembrolizumab has regulatory approval for PD-L1 positive carcinomas. This meta-analysis investigates available data on the efficacy of PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibitors as a class in gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas. The literature was reviewed to identify clinical studies that included arms with PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibitors as monotherapy in gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas. Relevant patient characteristics, outcomes, and adverse effects were recorded. Summary estimates of response rates (RR) and survival were calculated using a random or fixed effect model, depending on heterogeneity. Six studies with a total of 1068 patients were included in the analysis. The summary RR was 10.63% (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.36-15.89%). The summary disease control rate (DCR) was 28.11% (95% CI 24.60-31.63%). Summary progression-free survival (PFS) was 1.59 months (95% CI 1.24-1.94 months). Summary overall survival (OS) was 5.72 months (95% CI 0-12.19 months). A subset of patients derived long-term benefits as seen in other cancer locations. The adverse effect rate was low and consistent with that in other disease locations. Low efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors as a class in gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas is observed in this analysis and stresses the need for effective biomarker use for the identification of most probable responders.

       "  'AB': 'Trastuzumab is the standard of care for HER2-positive breast cancer patients, markedly improving disease-free and overall survival. Combined with chemotherapy, it enhances patient outcomes, but cardiotoxicity due to the trastuzumab treatment poses a serious adverse effect. MM-302 is a HER2-targeted PEGylated liposome that encapsulates doxorubicin to facilitate its delivery to HER2-overexpressing tumor cells while limiting exposure to nontarget tissues, including the heart. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility and preclinical activity of combining MM-302 with trastuzumab. MM-302 and trastuzumab target different domains of the HER2 receptor and thus could simultaneously bind HER2-overexpressing tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, trastuzumab did not disrupt the mechanism of action of MM-302 in delivering doxorubicin to the n0ucleus and inducing DNA damage. Reciprocally, MM-302 did not interfere with the ability of trastuzumab to block prosurvival p-Akt signaling. Interestingly, coadministration of the two agents acutely increased the deposition of MM-302 in human xenograft tumors and subsequently increased the expression of the DNA damage marker p-p53. Finally, the combination of MM-302 and trastuzumab induced synergistic antitumor activity in HER2-overexpressing xenograft models of breast and gastric cancer. Collectively, our findings highlight a novel combination therapy that efficiently targets HER2-overexpressing cells through multiple mechanisms and support the ongoing investigation of combined MM-302/trastuzumab therapy for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer in a randomized phase II clinical trial.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'In cancer patients, a cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a prevalent occurrence. When a patient has both heart disease and cancer, the treatment can be complicated because treatment for one condition can have an adverse effect on the outcome of the other. A cardiovascular disease that involves heart failures, coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, pericardial diseases, arrhythmias, and valve and vascular dysfunction is a serious worry for long-term cancer patients. Because preclinical research is limited, it is critical to comprehend the pathophysiology of CVD as a consequence of anticancerous therapies while taking into account the developing and expanding heart. As a result, in this research, we look at the epidemiological characteristics of cancer patients who also have cardiovascular illness. Low-dose chest computed tomography, cardiac CT, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used to acquire the data and perform the screening. Chemotherapeutic drugs such as anthracyclines and trastuzumab are used to treat the condition. Univariate analysis is used to examine risk factors and predict cardiovascular damage. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, life expectancy, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and longitudinal strain are among the metrics examined.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"INTRODUCTION: The utility of two-drug chemotherapy regimens in elderly or performance status (PS 2) patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains to be established. Preclinical studies suggested that celecoxib, a Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, has antitumor activity in NSCLC and can enhance the activity of chemotherapy drugs. We conducted a phase II study to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of weekly docetaxel and celecoxib in advanced NSCLC patients, who were either elderly (> or =70 years) or PS2. METHODS: Patients with stage IIIB (with pleural effusion) or IV NSCLC who were > or =70 years and had a PS of 0-2 or patients of any age with a PS of 2 were included. Patients should have been off any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug for 30 continuous days before study enrollment. Patients were treated with weekly docetaxel 36 mg/m i.v. on days 1, 8, 15 of a 28 day cycle and Celecoxib 400 mg po twice daily. Disease assessment was performed after every two cycles. The study design required 39 patients. RESULTS: Study was terminated after 34 patients were enrolled due to safety concerns regarding celecoxib. Thirty patients were evaluable. The response rate was 15%. The median progression free survival and median survival were 2.3 months and 5.0 months, respectively. The median survival of patients > or =70 years old with a PS of 0-1 was 8.3 months and the median survival of PS2 patients was 2.8 months. The combination was well tolerated with fatigue as the most common adverse effect. Two patients developed arterial thrombotic events. CONCLUSION: In these 'special populations' of patients with advanced NSCLC, the addition of celecoxib to docetaxel did not seem to improve the outcome compared with single agent docetaxel.\",\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Immunity plays a major role in carcinogenesis and this is the case also for hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). Checkpoint inhibitors, novel drugs that enhance the immune system's ability to attack cancers, have been successfully introduced for the therapy of various malignancies including HCC. An important target of these drugs is the PD-L1/PD-1 ligand/receptor pair and several clinically available inhibitors of this pair exist. DATA SOURCES: A search of the literature until April 20, 2019 was performed in the MEDLINE/PubMed database, the Embase database and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The clinical studies describing treatment with PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitors as monotherapy in HCC patients were retrieved. Patient characteristics with relevance for treatment efficacy, such as liver function, disease extend and previous treatment, were extracted from identified articles. Response and survival outcomes were the primary focus of the meta-analysis. Summary estimates of response rates and survival were calculated using a random or fixed effect model, depending on heterogeneity. Most common adverse effects were also recorded and summarized. RESULTS: Three studies (two on nivolumab and one on pembrolizumab) with a total of 400 patients were included in the analysis. The summary response rate (RR) was 17.3% [95% confidence interval (CI): 13.2%-21.4%]. The summary disease control rate (DCR) was 56.6% (95% CI: 44.7%-68.5%). Summary progression free survival (PFS) was 3.5 months (95% CI: 2.8-4.2 months). Summary overall survival (OS) was 10.4 months (95% CI: 3.5-17.2 months). Adverse effect rate was low and also consistent with the adverse effect profile of PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitors in other disease locations. CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab and nivolumab are the only checkpoint inhibitors with data in HCC. Meta-analysis of their effectiveness discloses rates not dissimilar to other systemic therapies available for this disease. Of interest also are the observed long responses in a sub-set of responders. Further development is clearly warranted.\",\n",

Cutaneous toxicities are of the most common adverse effects and occur with a range of severity. Bullous Pemphigoid is a rare adverse event with a high impact on quality of life that may occur after immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment. In this article, we investigate current research on immune checkpoint inhibitors, cutaneous adverse events, and common presentations and treatments, with a specific focus on Bullous Pemphigoid, its characteristics, onset timing, and treatment.

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVES: Drug-induced atrial fibrillation (AF) is considered an adverse effect of chemotherapeutic drugs. AF is a crucial risk factor for stroke, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and mortality. Pulmonary veins (PVs) are considered triggers inducing AF, and the sinoatrial node (SAN) may modulate PV activity and participate in AF genesis. AF was associated with early discontinuation of trastuzumab in patients with breast cancer. However, whether trastuzumab directly modulates the electrophysiological characteristics of PV and SAN remains unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ECG and conventional microelectrode system were used to record rabbit heart rhythm in vivo and electrical activities in vitro from isolated SAN, PV, and SAN-PV preparations. RESULTS: Trastuzumab reduced the beating rate in isolated PV and SAN preparations at 1, 10, and 30 μM (particularly in isolated SAN preparations) and induced burst firings in isolated PV preparations at 10 μΜ. In addition, trastuzumab (10 μM) induced SAN-PV conduction block and burst firings, which were blocked by wortmannin (a PI3K inhibitor, 100 nM). Similarly, ECG recordings showed that acute intravenous administration of trastuzumab (10 mg/kg) reduced rabbit heart rates. CONCLUSION: Trastuzumab increased PV arrhythmogenesis through interfering with PI3K signaling, which may contribute to the genesis of AF.',\n",

However, DOCX has adverse effect on normal tissues through the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), despite the adverse effect was inhibited by antioxidants. We investigated the protective role of selenium against DOCX-induced apoptosis and mitochondrial oxidative injury in laryngotracheal epithelial (LARYN) cells of mice. Thirty-two mice were divided into four groups (n\\u2009=\\u20098). The first group was used as a control. The second and third groups were treated with sodium selenite (Na-Sel) and DOCX, respectively. The fourth group was the combined group of Na-Sel and DOCX. At the end of the experiment, LARYN mucosa and cells were obtained from the mice. In the LARYN cells, the cell viability level was low in DOCX group, although glutathione peroxidase activity and cell viability level were increased by the treatment of Na-Sel. Increased lipid peroxidation, intracellular ROS, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, cell death levels, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, caspase -3, and -9 activities in the DOCX group of LARYN cells were diminished by the treatment of Na-Sel. In conclusion, DOCX increased mitochondrial ROS, cell death, and inflammation in the LARYN cells, although the increase was reduced in the cells by Na-Sel treatment. DOCX-induced adverse oxidant, inflammatory, and apoptotic effects in the tissue might be reduced by the Na-Sel treatment.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Flaxseed oil (FO), which is rich in n-3 fatty acid, is commonly consumed by breast cancer patients because of its potential anti-cancer effects. Trastuzumab (TRAS) is the primary drug for epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer. We investigated in athymic mice whether combining dietary FO (8%) with TRAS treatment (2.5 or 5mg/kg body weight) can cause better or adverse effect on established human breast tumors overexpressing HER2 (BT-474). Control tumors significantly grew 187%, TRAS2.5 treated tumors did not change, while TRAS5, FO+TRAS2.5 and FO+TRAS5 treated tumors significantly regressed 75%, 89% and 84%, respectively, after 4weeks treatment. Two weeks after stopping TRAS treatment while continuing on same diet, tumor size in FO+TRAS2.5 group was 87% lower than in TRAS2.5 group and was not different from TRAS5 group with or without FO. Combined TRAS2.5 treatment with FO caused a significantly lower tumor cell proliferation and higher apoptosis compared to TRAS2.5 treatment alone and showed similar effect to TRAS5 treatment with or without FO. Hence, FO did not interfere with TRAS but rather enhanced its tumor-reducing effects and combined FO and low dose TRAS was as effective as high dose TRAS treatment.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity (CIPN) is a major adverse effect of cancer treatment. However, its impact remains poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the impact associated with CIPN on the lives of cancer survivors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A volunteer sample of 986 individuals who had received neurotoxic chemotherapy completed an anonymous, cross-sectional survey. Outcomes assessed included CIPN symptoms, pain, neuropathic pain, quality of life (QoL), physical activity, and comorbid health conditions via the Self-Administered Comorbidity Questionnaire. RESULTS: Respondents had a mean age of 58 years (SD, 10.7), and 83.2% were female. Most were treated for breast (58.9%) or colorectal cancer (13.5%); had received docetaxel (32.7%), paclitaxel (31.6%), or oxaliplatin (12.5%); and had completed treatment 3.6 ± 3.5 years previously. We found that 76.5% of respondents reported current CIPN. Respondents reporting severe CIPN had poorer QoL, more comorbidities, and higher body mass index, and more often received multiple neurotoxic chemotherapies than those with mild CIPN. Respondents who completed the survey ≤1 year after completing chemotherapy did not differ in reported CIPN or pain compared with respondents who completed chemotherapy ≥6 years earlier. However, respondents who completed chemotherapy ≥6 years earlier reported better QoL. Multivariable linear regression analyses revealed predictors of CIPN severity as follows: F(7, 874) = 64.67; P<.001; R2 = 0.34, including pain (β = -0.36; P<.001), burning pain (β = 0.25; P<.001), sex (male sex associated with greater CIPN: β = 0.14; P<.001), years since completing chemotherapy (shorter time associated with greater CIPN; β = -0.10; P<.001), age (β = 0.80; P=.006), number of comorbid conditions (β = 0.07; P=.02), and body mass index (β = 0.07; P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: Respondents with a high CIPN symptom burden experienced poorer general health and QoL. Improvements in CIPN may be more likely soon after treatment. However, improvements in QoL may occur over time in those with chronic symptoms. CIPN seems to have lasting impacts on cancer survivors, and understanding risk factors is important to enable the design of further preventive and therapeutic management strategies.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Taxanes are key drugs for patients with breast cancer. A major adverse effect of taxanes is peripheral neuropathy (PN). To investigate the ability of compression therapy using sleeves and stockings to prevent PN due to the taxane docetaxel, we conducted a single-center historical control trial. Patients receiving docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 4 cycles as first-line chemotherapy for breast cancer were eligible. PN was evaluated using the common terminology criteria for adverse events version 4.0. The primary endpoint was the incidence of allgrade PN until 3 weeks after the fourth docetaxel administration. We evaluated 26 patients in the intervention group and compared their data to those collected retrospectively from 52 patients treated with docetaxel without compression. Neither the incidence of all-grade PN until 3 weeks after the fourth docetaxel administration (63.5% in the control group vs. 76.9% in the intervention group, p=0.31) nor that of PN grade ≥ 2 (13.5% vs. 15.4%, p=0.99) differed between the groups. In this study, the efficacy of compression therapy using sleeves and stockings to prevent PN induced by docetaxel was not demonstrated. Further clinical studies including medications or intervention are needed to reduce the incidence and severity of PN induced by chemotherapy.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Trastuzumab is a mainstay chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu-positive breast cancer that, though generally well-tolerated, is classically associated with side effects like cardiotoxicity. Cytopenias can be seen but are generally secondary to other chemotherapeutic agents used in conjunction with trastuzumab. Herein, we present a case of recurrent severe thrombocytopenia following trastuzumab use that resolved following discontinuation.\\xa0Our patient then finished a year of maintenance therapy with pertuzumab alone and is still in remission four years later.\\xa0This is the eleventh report of this severe adverse effect described in the literature. This report contributes to the body of work describing this severe side effect by illustrating\\xa0a clear temporal relationship between trastuzumab and severe thrombocytopenia, while also providing\\xa0an alternate treatment option with chemotherapy and pertuzumab monotherapy. Given that pertuzumab is typically only used in addition to trastuzumab, evidence of its successful independent use is of clinical value to patients who may not be able to tolerate trastuzumab.',\n",

In a Phase II trial in men with hormone refractory prostate cancer, DMXAA (ASA404) in combination with docetaxel achieved a prostate-specific antigen response in more patients than docetaxel therapy alone, and was generally well tolerated.

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: Neratinib is an oral, irreversible pan-ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The efficacy and safety of neratinib were evaluated in two cohorts of patients with advanced ErbB2-positive breast cancer-those with and those without prior trastuzumab treatment-in an open-label, multicenter, phase II trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients in the two cohorts (prior trastuzumab, n = 66; no prior trastuzumab, n = 70) received oral neratinib 240 mg once daily. The primary end point was the 16-week progression-free survival (PFS) rate for the evaluable population (prior trastuzumab, n = 63; no prior trastuzumab, n = 64), as assessed by independent review. RESULTS: The 16-week PFS rates were 59% for patients with prior trastuzumab treatment and 78% for patients with no prior trastuzumab treatment. Median PFS was 22.3 and 39.6 weeks, respectively. Objective response rates were 24% among patients with prior trastuzumab treatment and 56% in the trastuzumab-naïve cohort. The most common adverse events were diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. Diarrhea was the most frequent grades 3 to 4 adverse event, occurring in 30% of patients with prior trastuzumab treatment and in 13% of patients with no prior trastuzumab treatment, which prompted dose reductions in 29% and 4% of patients, respectively, but treatment discontinuation in only one patient. No neratinib-related, grades 3 or 4 cardiotoxicity was reported. CONCLUSION: Oral neratinib showed substantial clinical activity and was reasonably well tolerated among both heavily pretreated and trastuzumab-naïve patients who had advanced, ErbB2-positive breast cancer. Diarrhea was the most common adverse effect but was manageable with antidiarrheal agents and dose modification.',\n",

The overall response rates for melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were 29% (95% CI: 1.53-2.41), 21% (95% CI: 17%-25%) and 21% (95% CI: 16%-27%) respectively. While the overall adverse effects rate for melanoma, NSCLC, RCC were 16% (95% CI: 6%-28%), 11% (95% CI: 8%-14%) and 20% (95% CI: 11%-32%) respectively. Tumor PD-L1 expression and patient smoking status might serve as biomarkers to predict response of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody treatment. Compared to tumors with negative PD-L1 expression, tumors with positive PD-L1 expression had a significantly higher clinical response rate (41.4% versus 26.5%) with RR = 1.92 (95% CI: 1.53-2.41, P < 0.001). Smoker patients also showed a significantly higher response rate (33.7%) than patients who never smoked (4.2%) with RR = 6.02 (95% CI: 1.22-29.75, P = 0.028). Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab were associated with significantly increased response rate (RR = 2.89, 95% CI: 2.46-3.40, P < 0.001), reduced death risk (HR= 0.53; 95% CI: 0.48-0.57; P < 0.001), and decreased adverse effect rate (RR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.30-0.80, P = 0.004) compared with other therapies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Clinical trials reporting response or safety of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies for advanced or refractory cancer patients published before January 31th 2016 were searched in PubMed and EMBASE database. Meta-analyses using random effects models were used to calculate the overall estimate. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies have high response rates and low adverse effect rates for advanced or refractory cancers.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVE: Lower extremity lymphedema (LEL) is a well-known adverse effect related to cervical and endometrial cancer (CEC); however, very few studies have elucidated the clinicopathologic risk factors related to LEL. We investigated the incidence and risk factors in patients who received primary surgery and/or adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) or chemotherapy for CEC. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 2,565 patients who underwent primary surgery following CEC diagnosis between January 2007 and December 2020. LEL diagnosis was based on objective and subjective assessments by experts. We identified important predictors of LEL to construct a nomogram predicting individual risks of LEL. For internal validation of the nomogram, the original data were separated using the split-sample method in a 7:3 ratio of training data and test data. RESULTS: Overall, 858 patients (33.5%) received RT, 586 received external beam RT (EBRT), and 630 received intracavitary RT. During follow-up period, LEL developed in 331 patients, with an overall cumulative 5-year incidence of 13.3%. In multivariate analysis, age at primary treatment, use of docetaxel-based chemotherapy, type of hysterectomy, type of surgical pelvic lymph node (LN) assessment, number of dissected pelvic and para-aortic LNs, and EBRT field were the independent predictors of LEL. We subsequently developed the nomogram showing excellent predictive power for LEL. CONCLUSION: LEL is associated with various treatment modalities, and their interactions may increase the possibility of occurrences. De-escalation strategies for treatment modalities should be considered to reduce LEL in patients with CEC.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'INTRODUCTION: Pembrolizumab and other immune checkpoint inhibitors are the emerging treatment for selected, high-grade malignancies. However, a small number of patients are unable to tolerate its adverse effects, leading to discontinuation of this potentially life-changing therapy. In this study, we present a case of high-grade urothelial carcinoma patient, who experienced neurocomplications during the first pembrolizumab administration. However, we were able to limit the adverse effect by concomitant use of low-dose oral steroids. CASE PRESENTATION: A 75-year-old Taiwanese female with high-grade urothelial carcinoma of the left ureter came to the neurology clinic with complaints of acute onset of bilateral ptosis 16 days after her first infusion of pembrolizumab. It was found that she developed complete bilateral ptosis and limited extraocular muscle movements. Myasthenia gravis-related antibodies and repetitive stimulation test were negative. We diagnosed her with pembrolizumab-induced myasthenia gravis-like disorder and myositis based on clinical symptoms and elevation of muscle enzymes. We commenced methylprednisolone pulse therapy followed by oral steroid therapy with gradual resolution of the symptoms. Three months later, the patient received a second cycle of pembrolizumab with low-dose oral steroids without any complications. CONCLUSION: Pembrolizumab exerts its antitumor activity by interfering with the binding of programmed death 1 and its ligand, programmed death ligand 1. As a result, enhanced cytotoxic T cells can recognize tumor cells and induce cellular death. However, neurological complications may be severe and require prompt recognition and treatment. Our case demonstrated that concomitant use of low-dose steroids and pembrolizumab might prevent such complications.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'The role of chemotherapy in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been debated over three decades, but it is only relatively recently that chemotherapy has become a standard of care for this disease. In addition to prolonging survival, chemotherapy can palliate distressing symptoms. Concerns that the adverse effects of chemotherapy are likely to outweigh its benefits have largely not been confirmed by quality-of-life data reported among patients with good performance status. Platinum-based chemotherapy regimens in which cisplatin or carboplatin are partnered by a third-generation cytotoxic drug such as gemcitabine, paclitaxel or vinorelbine, have similar activity and efficacy, but differ in adverse effect profiles. Response rates of 30-40% should be expected with median and 1-year survival of 8-10 months and 30-40%, respectively. In the second-line setting chemotherapy with docetaxel has been shown to be significantly superior to best supportive care alone. In a recent trial that compared docetaxel to the novel antifolate, pemetrexed the response rates and survival rates did not differ, but the toxicity profile favored pemetrexed. Overall, these data demonstrate that progress has been made in the use of chemotherapy to improve survival in patients with NSCLC without increasing the incidence of further toxicity. In the past, the potential to survive 1 year was extremely small, whereas now many more patients reach this milestone as well as the 2-year point. However, a plateau has probably been reached with existing cytotoxic drugs and there is a general belief that the next significant advance in the treatment of NSCLC will come from the addition of drugs that target specific molecular pathways in sequence with standard chemotherapy regimens.',\n",

Although generally well tolerated, the potential for significant adverse effects, specifically immune related adverse effects (irAEs) needs to be taken into consideration. Several cases of bullous pemphigoid have been reported as a cutaneous adverse effect of ICIs since 2015, and there are recent reports of mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP). We present the case of an 84-year-old male with metastatic urothelial carcinoma on treatment with pembrolizumab, who developed laryngeal mucous membrane pemphigoid as an irAE. The diagnosis was based on patient's clinical history and serologic testing, and supported by symptomatic improvement after ICI discontinuation and immunosuppression. Pembrolizumab-induced MMP is a newly described and infrequent irAE, requiring early suspicion and close monitoring for its diagnosis and management.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'IMPORTANCE: Persistent chemotherapy-induced alopecia (pCIA) has been recently described in patients with breast cancer and in its most severe form occurs in up to 10% of these patients. Genetic risk factors associated with pCIA have not been adequately explored. OBJECTIVE: To identify genetic variants associated with pCIA. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this genetic association study, 215 women with breast cancer treated with docetaxel-based chemotherapy with a follow-up of 1.5 to 10 years after the end of the treatment were recruited retrospectively through 3 hospital oncology units across Spain between 2005 and 2018. Severe pCIA was defined as lack of scalp hair recovery (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0, grade 2) 18 months or more after the end of treatment. Patients with grade 2 pCIA were selected as cases, and those with no sign of residual alopecia 12 months after the end of docetaxel treatment were selected as controls. A genome-wide association study in a discovery phase was conducted, and logistic regression was used to identify variants associated with the risk to develop this adverse effect. The validity of the association was addressed through a replication phase. EXPOSURES: Docetaxel-based chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Genotypes of single-nucleotide variants associated with pCIA. RESULTS: In total, 215 women with breast cancer (median age, 51.6 years; interquartile range, 44-60 years) were recruited (173 patients for the discovery phase and 42 patients for the replication phase). In the discovery phase, ABCB1 genetic variants were associated with risk to develop pCIA. In particular, single-nucleotide variation rs1202179, a regulatory variant located in an enhancer element that interacts with the ABCB1 promoter, was associated with the occurrence of pCIA. This finding was validated in the replication cohort (combined odds ratio, 4.05; 95% CI, 2.46-6.67; P\\u2009=\\u20093.946\\u2009×\\u200910-8). This variant is associated with ABCB1 mRNA expression, and the risk allele was associated with decreased ABCB1 expression levels (P\\u2009=\\u20091.64\\u2009×\\u200910-20). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This is the first study, to our knowledge, that identifies an association between a regulatory variant in the ABCB1 gene and the occurrence of pCIA in patients with breast cancer who were treated with docetaxel-based therapies. This finding suggests an important insight into the biological mechanisms underlying pCIA and opens the opportunity to explore personalized treatment of these patients.',\n",

The purpose of this study was to gain insight into LVEF monitoring during adjuvant trastuzumab treatment in clinical practice. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a multicenter retrospective study encompassing 328 patients, of which 171 patients were actually treated with trastuzumab, we analyzed the frequency and mode of LVEF monitoring and compared it with LVEF monitoring guidelines. RESULTS: The results indicated poor guideline adherence. In 9% of patients trastuzumab was started in spite of a low LVEF (< 55%). In 24% of patients no valid baseline LVEF value was available. LVEF measurements during treatment at three, six and 12 months were only performed in, respectively, 53%, 40% and 30% of patients. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of patients are treated with trastuzumab, while LVEF monitoring is not adequately performed. More attention should be paid to the implementation of (cardiac assessment) guidelines in clinical practice.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (TPF) regimen followed by intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) on locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). METHODS: A total of 150 patients with locally advanced NPC [American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 2009 stage IIIa-IVb] received 2 or 3 cycles of a TPF regimen as induction chemotherapy. A group of 67 participants (TPF group) continued to receive TPF chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and the remaining 83 participants (P group) received cisplatin chemotherapy and radiotherapy. RESULTS: A median follow-up of 35 months (4-66 months) showed that there was no significant difference between P group and TPF group in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The incidence rate of myelosuppression at 3-4 degrees was 16.9% and 34.3% in the P group and TPF group (P=0.029), respectively, and the oral mucosa reaction at 3-4 degrees was 18.1% and 37.3% in the P group and TPF group, respectively (P=0.007). The 3-4-degree skin reaction in the P group and TPF group was 15.7% and 29.9% (P=0.030), respectively. The rate of liver function injury in the P group was significantly lower than that in TPF group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with concurrent cisplatin chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the concurrent TPF regimen and IMRT showed no significant improvement in OS and PFS in patients with advanced NPC, but exhibited more severe hematologic toxicity, oral mucosal responses, skin reactions, and liver functional impairment.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Therapy related acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) have been classically linked to alkylating agents and topoisomerase inhibitors. They constitute about 1% of all AMLs. There is less evidence on association of taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel) with these myeloid neoplasms. We present a case of paclitaxel therapy related acute myelogenous leukemia after treatment of endometrial cancer with a regimen containing paclitaxel and carboplatin. A 63-year-old female underwent surgery followed by a total of 6 cycles of chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel. Six months after last cycle of chemotherapy, she was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome with refractory anemia and excess blasts. Six weeks later, she had worsening anemia and thrombocytopenia which prompted a bone marrow biopsy which revealed acute myelomonocytic leukemia. A thorough literature review revealed 12 other case reports where taxanes have been implicated in the development of therapy related myeloid neoplasm. Based on the timeline of events in our patient, paclitaxel is the likely culprit in the pathogenesis of this myeloid neoplasm. This rare but significantly grave adverse effect should be kept in consideration when deciding on treatment options for gynecological malignancies.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Docetaxel is currently licensed for use in a variety of malignancies, including breast cancer and lung cancer, and is the preferred taxane in breast cancer treatment. In ovarian cancer, the taxane of choice has historically been paclitaxel; however, there is now substantial evidence that docetaxel also may be the preferred taxane in this disease. Docetaxel has many preclinical advantages over paclitaxel and has been shown to be effective in both platinum- and paclitaxel-resistant disease. Phase I and II studies have shown docetaxel plus carboplatin to be feasible, and the combination is associated with a tolerable adverse-effect profile. The Scottish Randomized Trial in Ovarian Cancer (SCOTROC) trial randomly assigned 1,077 patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage Ic to IV disease to six cycles of docetaxel plus carboplatin (DC) or paclitaxel plus carboplatin (PC) as primary chemotherapy. Progression-free survival is not statistically different, and to date, no differences are apparent in overall survival. Toxicity differences were evident. There was more myelosuppression with DC but no additional mortality. More neuropathy was present with PC, with more patients stopping paclitaxel because of this toxicity during chemotherapy. Quality-of-life analyses highlighted important differences, all favoring the DC treatment arm. Additional SCOTROC studies using docetaxel are ongoing. These data indicate that docetaxel and carboplatin represent a reasonable first-line option for patients with newly diagnosed epithelial ovarian cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Docetaxel is an equally active alternative to paclitaxel in advanced ovarian cancer but has a different adverse effect profile. Whilst paclitaxel is associated with less haematological toxicity, such as febrile neutropenia and anaemia, docetaxel causes less sensory and motor neuropathy. OBJECTIVE: To measure the economic value and preference scores for docetaxel as an alternative to paclitaxel in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. DESIGN AND SETTING: A cost-benefit analysis using a consumer-based willingness-to-pay (WTP) approach was conducted. The study population consisted of a patient surrogate sample comprised of 80 oncology pharmacists and nurses from eight Canadian provinces. Background information on ovarian cancer was provided including its current management, and differences in adverse effects between docetaxel and paclitaxel. Respondents were then asked what their preferred product would be if they were diagnosed with ovarian cancer and how much they would be willing to pay per cycle for six cycles in the form of a co-payment (i.e. user's fee) for the product of their choice. The maximum willingness to pay for docetaxel was then compared against the incremental cost (acquisition and administration) of the drug. STUDY PERSPECTIVE: Canadian healthcare system perspective. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: The WTP survey instrument was simple to administer and easily understood by participants. Respondents ranked motor neuropathy as being the most unpleasant adverse effect of treatment. Of the sample, 63.8% preferred to use docetaxel instead of paclitaxel (p = 0.075). The patient surrogate sample was willing to pay a mean of 64 Canadian dollars (dollars Can; 2003 values) [95% CI dollars Can33, dollars Can92] per cycle for the benefits offered by docetaxel as an alternative to paclitaxel. This estimate was marginally lower than the incremental cost of dollars Can87 per cycle of docetaxel. CONCLUSION: A substantial portion of Canadian patients with ovarian cancer would likely prefer to be treated with docetaxel instead of paclitaxel for the management of their disease and would be willing to pay a portion of the incremental cost. Therefore, both options should be offered to patients, and selection of treatment can be based on reducing the risk of the toxicity that concerns the patient the most.\",\n",

He was treated for community-acquired pneumonia and pulmonary emboli but rapidly deteriorated, with increasing hypoxia and dyspnoea. He was admitted to the intensive care unit for support with continuous positive airway pressure and high flow nasal oxygen. His clinical condition improved once he received high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone to treat pneumonitis. His treatment was continued with a weaning course of high-dose oral steroids, and he was discharged with a persistent oxygen requirement.

The aim of this retrospective study was to estimate the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib treatment in Chinese mBC patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the real-world clinicopathological and treatment data of HER2-positive mBC patients receiving pyrotinib-based treatment from August 2018 to July 2019 in Qilu Hospital of Shandong University and other medical centers of Shandong Province in China. RESULTS: A total of 64 patients treated with pyrotinib were included for analysis, and the median follow-up duration was 260 days (interquartile range, 199.0 to 339.0 days). Fifty-nine (92.2%) patients had been previously treated with trastuzumab and/or T-DM1, while 11 (17.2%) patients had been exposed to lapatinib. The objective response rate (ORR) of all patients was 73.4%, and the disease control rate (DCR) was 98.4%, with a clinical benefit rate (CBR) of 87.5%. Patients with exposure to lapatinib responded well to pyrotinib-based treatment, although the ORR was significantly lower compared with that of patients without exposure to lapatinib (44.1% vs 77.5%, p=0.037). Previous lapatinib exposure was negatively associated with the objective response of pyrotinib treatment (odds ratio [OR]=0.248, 95% confidence interval [CI]\\xa00.063-0.970, p=0.045). The median progression-free survival (mPFS) for patients with previous lapatinib exposure and patients with visceral metastasis was 299 days (95% CI 240.1-357.9 days) and 359 days (95% CI 258.3-459.7 days), respectively. But the mPFS of the whole cohort has not been reached until the cut-off date. Cox multivariate analysis revealed that only visceral metastasis was an independent predictor of significantly shorter PFS (p=0.041) but not previous exposure to lapatinib (p=0.092). Diarrhea (28.1%), hand-foot syndrome (17.2%), and neutropenia (9.4%) were the most common grade 3 adverse events associated with pyrotinib treatment. CONCLUSION: Pyrotinib is highly beneficial to HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients, even in patients with previous lapatinib exposure. Pyrotinib is a feasible replacement of lapatinib in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs or as a monotherapy. Adverse effects are tolerable and easily manageable.',\n",

Pembrolizumab, an a monoclonal antibody, targeting the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) pathway. CPIs have been associated with a number of immune-related adverse events (AEs), including musculoskeletal and rheumatic disease. OBJECTIVE: To present a case with lung adenocarcinoma treated with pembrolizumab, which developed inflammatory arthritis and fasciitis. CASE REPORT: A 73-year-old male patient was referred to the rheumatology outpatient clinic with complaints of pain in the pretibial area, pain and swelling in both ankles joints and the right fırst metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint. Three months ago he had diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma and pembrolizumab was started. Locomotor system complaints were started after receiving two infusions of pembrolizumab. Physical examination revealed both ankle arthritis, mild edema in the pretibial region, tenderness in the muscles and arthritis in the right fırst MCP joint. Laboratory examinations showed mild acute phase reactants elevation. Lower extremity MRI showed diffuse edema in both gastrocnemius muscle and fascia, compatible with fasciitis. Pembrolizumab-related fasciitis and seronegative arthritis were diagnosed. Low dose corticosteroid was started and a significant regression was observed in the patient's complaints. CONCLUSION: Inflammatory myositis with fasciitis and inflammatory arthritis in lower extremities appears to be a new adverse effect of pembrolizumab therapy.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'Rationale: IgA can induce activation of neutrophils which are the most abundant cell type in blood, but the development of IgA as therapeutic has been confounded by its short half-life and a weak ability to recruit NK cells as effector cells. Therefore, we generated an X-shaped antibody (X-body) based on the principle of molecular self-assembly that combines the activities of both IgG and IgA, which can effectively recruit and activate NK cells, macrophages, and neutrophils to kill tumor cells. Methods: X-body was generated by using a self-assembly strategy. The affinity of the X-body with the antigen and Fc receptors was tested by surface plasmon resonance. The shape of X-body was examined using negative staining transmission electron microscopy. The tumor cell killing activity of X-body was assessed in vitro and in multiple syngeneic mouse models. To explore the mechanism of X-body, tumor-infiltrating immune cells were analyzed by single-cell RNA-seq and flow cytometry. The dependence of neutrophil, macrophage, and NK cells for the X-body efficacy was confirmed by in vivo depletion of immune cell subsets. Results: The X-body versions of rituximab and trastuzumab combined the full spectrum activity of IgG and IgA and recruited NK cells, macrophages, and neutrophils as effector cells for eradication of tumor cells. Treatment with anti-hCD20 and anti-hHER2 X-bodies leads to a greater reduction in tumor burden in tumor-bearing mice compared with the IgA or IgG counterpart, and no obvious adverse effect is observed upon X-body treatment. Moreover, the X-body has a serum half-life and drug stability comparable to IgG. Conclusions: The X-body, as a myeloid-cell-centered therapeutic strategy, holds promise for the development of more effective cancer-targeting therapies than the current state of the art.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'A 67-year-old man with non-small-cell lung carcinoma was referred to our department because of a pruritic rash on his head and upper extremities. Prior to the development of the rash, he had received 4 cycles of combination therapy with pemetrexed, carboplatin, and pembrolizumab, followed by 2 cycles of pembrolizumab monotherapy. On physical examination, violaceous scaly erythema grouped on his scalp and upper extremities. Histologically, the scalp lesions demonstrated irregular acanthosis that formed a characteristic saw-tooth appearance with hypergranulosis and typical lichenoid tissue reaction. These findings suggested that the scalp lesions were lichen planus. Two-week administration of topical corticosteroid dramatically improved the rash. Immunotherapy with pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, can induce T-cell activation that results in various immune-related adverse effects such as lichenoid tissue reaction. However, lichen planus is generally found on the extremities and/or oral mucosa, and unlike in this case, the scalp is rarely affected. Although the exact mechanism underlying predominant scalp involvement is unknown, the present case indicates that anti-PD-1 therapy-induced lichen planus can develop not only on the extremities and oral mucosa but also on the scalp. Interestingly, the lesions were not induced by the combination of chemotherapy and pembrolizumab; rather, they occurred soon after initiation of pembrolizumab monotherapy. In the present case, pembrolizumab-induced T-cell activation which triggered lichenoid tissue reaction may have been suppressed by chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression. Dermatologists should have a thorough knowledge of the cutaneous lesions that manifest as irAEs of anti-PD-1 therapy.',\n",

METHODS: A literature search was performed in the EMBASE, Medline, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Internet, Wan-fang databases. The trials that were found were then evaluated for eligibility. The Cochrane Collaboration's Review Manager software was used to perform the meta-analyses. RESULTS: Nine clinical trials including 1257 patients were included. The docetaxel plus cisplatin regimens had higher overall response rates compared with the docetaxel regimen (RR = 0.70; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.80; P < 0.00001). No statistically significant difference was observed between the two regimens with respect to the one-year survival rate (RR = 1.04; 95% CI, 0.90 to 1.19; P = 0.62). Patients treated with the DP regimen were more likely to experience anemia, thrombocytopenia, nausea/vomiting, nephrotoxicity, hyponatremia, mucositis and treatment-related deaths compared with patients treated with docetaxel alone. No significant difference was observed between the two regimens with respect to the occurrence of neurotoxicity, diarrhea, fatigue, pneumonitis, neutropenia and leucopenia. CONCLUSIONS: The docetaxel plus cisplatin combination regimen resulted in a high response rate and a high adverse effect rate compared with docetaxel monochemotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'The antipsychotic clozapine is uniquely effective in the management of schizophrenia; however, its use is limited by its potential to induce agranulocytosis. The causes of this, and of its precursor neutropenia, are largely unknown, although genetic factors have an important role. We sought risk alleles for clozapine-associated neutropenia in a sample of 66 cases and 5583 clozapine-treated controls, through a genome-wide association study (GWAS), imputed human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, exome array and copy-number variation (CNV) analyses. We then combined associated variants in a meta-analysis with data from the Clozapine-Induced Agranulocytosis Consortium (up to 163 cases and 7970 controls). In the largest combined sample to date, we identified a novel association with rs149104283 (odds ratio (OR)=4.32, P=1.79 × 10(-8)), intronic to transcripts of SLCO1B3 and SLCO1B7, members of a family of hepatic transporter genes previously implicated in adverse drug reactions including simvastatin-induced myopathy and docetaxel-induced neutropenia. Exome array analysis identified gene-wide associations of uncommon non-synonymous variants within UBAP2 and STARD9. We additionally provide independent replication of a previously identified variant in HLA-DQB1 (OR=15.6, P=0.015, positive predictive value=35.1%). These results implicate biological pathways through which clozapine may act to cause this serious adverse effect.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVES: The aim of CATS (Cardiotoxicity of Adjuvant Trastuzumab Study) was to prospectively assess clinical, biochemical, and genomic predictors of trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity (TRC). BACKGROUND: Cardiac dysfunction is a common adverse effect of trastuzumab. Studies to identify predictive biomarkers for TRC have enrolled heterogeneous populations and yielded mixed results. METHODS: A total of 222 patients with early-stage human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer scheduled to receive adjuvant anthracyclines followed by 12\\xa0months of trastuzumab were prospectively recruited from 17\\xa0centers. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), troponin T, and N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide were measured at baseline, post-anthracycline, and every 3\\xa0months during trastuzumab. Germline single-nucleotide polymorphisms in ERBB2, FCGR2A, and FCGR3A were analyzed. TRC was defined as symptomatic heart failure; cardiac death, arrhythmia, or infarction; a decrease in LVEF of >15% from baseline; or a decrease in LVEF of >10% to\\xa0<50%. RESULTS: TRC occurred in 18 of 217 subjects (8.3%). Lower pre-anthracycline LVEF and greater interval decline in LVEF from pre- to post-anthracycline were each associated with TRC on multivariate analyses (odds ratio: 3.9 [p\\xa0= 0.0001] and 7.9 [p\\xa0<\\xa00.0001] for a 5% absolute change in LVEF). Higher post-anthracycline N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide level was associated with TRC on univariate but not multivariate analyses. There were no associations between troponin T or ERBB2/FGCR polymorphisms and TRC. Baseline LVEF and LVEF change post-anthracycline were used to generate a \"low-risk TRC score\" to identify patients with low TRC incidence. CONCLUSIONS: Low baseline LVEF and greater LVEF decline post-anthracycline were both independent predictors of TRC. The other biomarkers did not further improve the ability to predict TRC.

       "  'AB': 'WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Trastuzumab can significantly prolong the survival of patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2)-positive breast cancer. Trastuzumab-induced thrombocytopenia is a rare adverse effect. There have been no reports of acute, grade 4 thrombocytopenia after weekly trastuzumab therapy. The study reports a case of a breast cancer patient with severe thrombocytopenia due to trastuzumab infusion (8\\xa0mg/kg). Moreover, the patient experienced recurrence of severe thrombocytopenia after receiving weekly trastuzumab therapy (4\\xa0mg/kg). CASE SUMMARY: A 52-year-old woman with HER-2-positive breast cancer developed diffuse petechial haemorrhages and ecchymosis on the lower limbs and gingival bleeding within 24 hours of trastuzumab infusion (8\\xa0mg/kg). She was confirmed to have severe thrombocytopenia, which quickly recovered after corticosteroid therapy and platelet transfusion. When her platelet count recovered, we attempted weekly trastuzumab therapy (4\\xa0mg/kg); however, thrombocytopenia recurred within 24 hours. Thus, we did not attempt further treatment with trastuzumab. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: We are the first to attempt weekly trastuzumab therapy after thrombocytopenia induced by its initial administration. Reducing the trastuzumab dose did not prevent trastuzumab-induced thrombocytopenia. Unlike other reports with administration of high-dose corticosteroid, we found that a standard dose of corticosteroid combined with platelet transfusion was effective in treating trastuzumab-induced thrombocytopenia.',\n",

This agent is indicated for the treatment of anthracycline-resistant metastatic breast cancer. The dose-limiting adverse effect is neutropenia, but febrile neutropenia is uncommon. Like paclitaxel, docetaxel is very active in patients with both chemotherapy-resistant and refractory metastatic breast cancer. Although the mechanism of action, spectrum of activity, and side effect profile of this agent are similar to those of paclitaxel, docetaxel may be efficacious in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have become resistant or refractory to paclitaxel therapy. However, more studies are warranted before the role of docetaxel is defined in patients with paclitaxel-resistant breast cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'AIM: To evaluate efficacy and safety of lapatinib or trastuzumab alone or both plus chemotherapy for the treatment of breast cancer patients with positive HER-2 expression. METHODS: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, MEDLINE, OVID, Embase, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and China Academic Journals Database were searched from 1994 through December 2017 using the keywords \"breast cancer\", \"preoperative\", \"neo-adjuvant\", \"lapatinib\", \"pertuzumab\", \"Herceptin\", and \"trastuzumab\". RESULTS: Meta-analysis found that pathological complete response (PCR; risk ratio [RR]=0.82, 95% CI: 0.72-0.93) and tall PCR (tPCR; RR=0.77, 95% CI: 0.67-0.88) of chemotherapy plus lapatinib were significantly less effective or safe compared to that of chemotherapy plus trastuzumab (P<0.05). PCR (RR=1.30, 95% CI: 1.15-1.47) and tPCR (RR=1.32, 95% CI: 1.16-1.50) of chemotherapy plus both lapatinib and trastuzumab were significantly superior to that of chemotherapy plus trastuzumab alone (P<0.05). However, there was no significant difference in breast reservation rate between chemotherapy plus lapatinib vs chemotherapy plus trastuzumab (RR=0.91, 95% CI: 0.72-1.16) or chemotherapy plus both lapatinib and trastuzumab (RR=1.11, 95% CI: 0.73-1.68, P>0.05). Incidence of diarrhea, hepatic toxicity, and skin rash in the groups of chemotherapy plus lapatinib or chemotherapy plus both lapatinib and trastuzumab was significantly higher than that in chemotherapy plus trastuzumab (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Efficacy of lapatinib was less than that of trastuzumab, but incidence of adverse effect of lapatinib was higher than that of trastuzumab. Combination of chemotherapy plus both lapatinib and trastuzumab could significantly increase PCR and tPCR in breast cancer patients, but rate of breast conservation, event-free survival, and overall survival was not significantly improved. Incidence of diarrhea, hepatic toxicity, and skin rash was significantly increased in the groups using lapatinib.',\n",

Here, we report a case of a 49-year-old female with stage 3 breast cancers who developed severe acute myositis following docetaxel use. The mechanism of docetaxel-induced myositis remains unclear; however, physicians still need to be aware of the possibility of this complication in patients with cancer and a history of exposure to this medication.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy has recently started to play a fundamental role in the management of metastatic melanoma. It is however accountable for many undesirable adverse effects involving many organ systems. Eosinophilic fasciitis is a rare immune-related adverse effect associated to checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab. We report the case of a 25-year-old male who received pembrolizumab as a second-line therapy for metastatic melanoma. Approximately 8\\u2009months after starting the treatment, the patient developed signs and symptoms of eosinophilic fasciitis, including edema of his hands and lower legs, as well as joint limitation. Pembrolizumab was discontinued after 15 cycles because of symptom progression. The patient experienced complete resolution of symptoms 4\\u2009months after cessation of pembrolizumab and without corticosteroids. This case illustrates the reversibility of this immune adverse effect by discontinuation of the treatment, speculating that corticotherapy may not be needed in all cases.',\n",

METHOD: Retrospective, multicenter, and observational study including patients with advanced refractory colorectal cancer who started TAS-102 between March 2016 and August 2018. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points included progression-free survival, toxicity and analyze prognostic factors present at the beginning of TAS-102. RESULT: 84 patients were evaluable. The median OS was 8.30 (95% CI 6.23-9.87) months and PFS was 2.62 (95% CI 2.36-3.05) months. In multivariate analysis, ECOG\\xa00 and reduced dose combined with more cycles were associated with better prognosis. Patients with an ECOG\\u2009>\\u20090 had worse prognosis (HR 3.34, 95% CI 1.09-10.27, p\\u2009=\\u20090.035). 95.2% experienced some type of adverse effect and 45.2% had grade\\u2009≥\\u20093 toxicities. CONCLUSION: Results suggest reconsidering TAS-102 in patients with ECOG >\\xa00, something that should be investigated in prospective randomized clinical trials.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Febrile neutropenia (FN) is one of the most common and most critical adverse effects of chemotherapy. Despite many existing guidelines based on the use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), FN continues to impair the quality of life and interfere with the treatment of many patients. The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence and management of FN associated with chemotherapy for early breast cancer in routine clinical practice. METHODS: All patients with early-stage breast cancer (ESBC) treated by chemotherapy at Institut Curie, Hôpital René Huguenin, in 2014 were retrospectively included. The incidence and management of FN were reported. Risk factors associated with FN were studied by robust-error-variance Poisson regression. RESULTS: A total of 524 patients received either neoadjuvant (N\\u2009=\\u2009130) or adjuvant chemotherapy (N\\u2009=\\u2009394). Most patients (80%) were treated with a combination of 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC100; 3\\xa0cycles) followed by docetaxel 100\\xa0mg/m(2) (D; 3\\xa0cycles). The overall incidence of FN was 17%. Eighteen percent of patients received primary prophylaxis (PP) for FN with G-CSF, using pegfilgrastim in 64% of cases and 74% of patients over the age of 70 received PP. Less than 5% of patients who received PP experienced FN. Recurrent FN after secondary prophylaxis was observed in 9% of patients. Forty-seven percent of cases of FN occurred after the first cycle and 30% occurred after the fourth cycle, corresponding to D ± trastuzumab (T). The FEC100 regimen was associated with a relative risk of FN of 1.98 (p\\u2009=\\u20090.09). Autoimmune (AI) and inflammatory diseases were associated with a higher risk of FN (RR 3.08; p\\u2009<\\u20090.01). No significant difference in the incidence of FN was observed between adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy. FN was managed on an outpatient basis in 72% of cases. Outpatients with FN were mainly treated by a combination of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and ciprofloxacin. Dose reduction or chemotherapy regimen modification were necessary in 25% of patients after FN. No toxic death was reported. CONCLUSION: The incidence of FN induced by adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy in ESBC is higher in routine clinical practice than in clinical trials. AI or inflammatory diseases were significant independent risk factors for FN. Primary prophylaxis in patients at risk (elderly, comorbid patients), especially treated with the FEC regimen, is the keystone of management of this adverse effect. Prevention and management of FN to ensure the patient's safety and quality of life are a major issue for both medical oncologists and supportive care physicians.\",\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody which binds to the extracellular domain of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), is the first biological drug approved for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. However, trastuzumab exhibits a series of clinical adverse effects, including cardiac toxicity, nerve damage, abnormal liver function, thrombocytopenia, etc. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of a 46-year-old female patient with invasive breast ductal carcinoma (classified as Stage 2B) who developed a rare severe edema in neck, face, chest, abdomen and both upper limbs after a single dose trastuzumab treatment. The patient (~60 kg weight) was administered with trastuzumab (420 mg) with an infusion time of 2 hours. The most severe edema symptom was observed in patient's hands, in which the epidermis was markedly transparent and tight. One month after trastuzumab administration, the patient was administered with methylprednisone (80 mg per day) for 5 days. The edema in patient's neck, face and both upper limbs was mildly reduced though the CT image showed no significant reduction of edema. CONCLUSIONS: Trastuzumab treatment for breast cancer patients, particularly those who have an allergic constitution, may have an adverse effect to develop severe edema, and treatment with methylprednisone at early stage can reduce such adverse reaction.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate the factors predicting efficacy and adverse effects of enzalutamide in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated data on 345 patients who had received enzalutamide for castration-resistant prostate cancer in 20 hospitals (Kyoto University Hospital and other satellite hospitals). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to identify factors predicting prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression after enzalutamide treatment and logistic regression analysis for those associated with development of adverse effects. RESULTS: PSA titers decreased by >50\\xa0% in 197 patients (57\\xa0%). The median PSA progression free survival was 163\\xa0days. Gleason score >8 (HR 2.078, 95\\xa0% CI 1.37-3.153, P\\xa0=\\xa00.00058), performance status ≥1 (HR 2.292, 95\\xa0% CI 1.463-3.592, P\\xa0=\\xa00.000296), presence of bone metastasis (HR 1.774, 95\\xa0% CI 1.019-3.090, P\\xa0=\\xa00.0429), visceral metastasis (HR 2.127, 95\\xa0% CI 1.215-3.722, P\\xa0=\\xa00.00823), previous steroid treatment (HR 1.780, 95\\xa0% CI 1.207-2.626, P\\xa0=\\xa00.00361) and docetaxel treatment (HR 1.602, 95\\xa0% CI 1.051-2.442, P\\xa0=\\xa00.0284) significantly predicted the efficacy of enzalutamide. Adverse effects, including fatigue or appetite loss, occurred in 169 patients (49\\xa0%), 48 (18\\xa0%) of whom stopped enzalutamide. Age >75\\xa0years (HR 1.980, 95\\xa0% CI 1.270-3.09, P\\xa0=\\xa00.00246) and lower enzalutamide dose (HR 0.437, 95\\xa0% CI 0.255-1.270, P\\xa0=\\xa00.00249) were significantly associated with development of adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: Enzalutamide treatment is effective in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer with low Gleason scores, good performance status, without bone or visceral metastasis and no prior steroid or docetaxel treatment. Lower doses of enzalutamide decrease the incidence of adverse effects, especially in older patients.',\n",

An imbalance in this immune response, however, could lead to immune-related adverse events (irAEs) involving multiple organs like rash, fatigue, hypo and hyperthyroidism, pneumonitis, hepatitis, and colitis, among others. Oral irAEs are not uncommon among immune checkpoint inhibitors which include xerostomia, dysgeusia, and lichenoid reactions; however, oral mucositis is rarely seen or reported in patients receiving PD-1 inhibitors. We present 3 cases of this rare complication in varying grades of severity. The patients were managed with steroids, either topical or systemic, depending on the severity of the lesions with either postponement or withholding therapy due to toxicity. Through this article, we hope to bring to light this overlooked and underdiagnosed oral adverse event associated with the use of immunotherapy and various treatment options for its management.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'CONTEXT: Advent of trastuzumab has brought tremendous changes in the survival of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2)-positive breast cancer patients. Despite the availability of the drug, it is still out of reach for many patients. There is very limited real world data regarding treatment challenges and survival analysis of these patients. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Primary objective is disease-free survival (DFS) and secondary objective is overall survival (OS) and toxicity profile. STATISTICS: Statistical analysis is done using GraphPad Prism 7.02. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study of all patients diagnosed with Her2-positive (Her2+) nonmetastatic invasive breast cancer from January 2007 to December 2013. RESULTS: In the period of this study, 885 patients are diagnosed with carcinoma breast, of which 212 are Her2/neu positive (23.9%). Of the 212 patients, only 76 (35.8%) patients received trastuzumab along with chemotherapy. Patients receiving trastuzumab with chemotherapy have longer 5-year DFS compared to those receiving chemotherapy alone, 92% and 52.6%, respectively (P = 0.0001). Five-year OS is 90.5% and 41.7% in those patients who received chemotherapy with and without trastuzumab, respectively (P = 0.0001). Seven patients (9.45%) developed Grade II reversible diastolic dysfunction. Grade II/III peripheral neuropathy due to paclitaxel is the main adverse effect seen in 21 patients. CONCLUSION: In spite of improvement in DFS and OS with trastuzumab, the number of patient receiving targeted therapy is very low due to financial constraints which need to be addressed to bridge the gap in survival of Her2+ patients.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Immunotherapy is gradually becoming as important as traditional therapy in the treatment of cancer, but adverse drug reactions limit patient benefits from PD1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor drugs in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). As a chemotherapeutic drug for NSCLC, docetaxel (DTX) can synergize with PD1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors but increase haematoxicity and neurotoxicity. Herein, anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb)-conjugated and docetaxel-loaded multifunctional lipid-shelled microbubbles (PDMs), which were designed with biologically safe phospholipids to produce synergistic antitumour effects, reduced the incidence of side effects and promoted therapeutic effects under ultrasound (US) irradiation. The PDMs were prepared by the acoustic-vibration method and then conjugated with an anti-PD-L1 mAb. The material features of the microbubbles and their cytotoxic effects, cellular apoptosis and cell cycle inhibition were studied. A subcutaneous tumour model was established to test the drug concentration-dependent and antitumour effects of the PDMs combined with US irradiation, and an orthotopic lung tumour model simultaneously confirmed the antitumour effect of this synergistic treatment. The PDMs achieved higher cellular uptake than free DTX, especially when combined with US irradiation. The PDMs combined with US irradiation also induced an increased rate of cellular apoptosis and an elevated G2-M arrest rate in cancer cells, which was positively correlated with PD-L1 expression. An in vivo study showed that synergistic treatment had relatively strong effects on tumour growth inhibition, increased survival time and decreased adverse effect rates. Our study possibly provides a well-controlled design for immunotherapy and chemotherapy and has promising potential for clinical application in NSCLC treatment.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: T-DM1 is an antibody drug conjugate with proven efficacy in metastatic breast cancer for progressive disease refractory to trastuzumab. Drug-induced pneumonitis is a rare serious potential adverse effect. The purpose of this review was to estimate the incidence of pulmonary toxicity at our institution. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of electronic medical record data inclusive of all women and men aged 18 years and older treated with T-DM1 at out institution was undertaken. The records were reviewed for clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence concerning for pneumonitis. We identified variables of interest with regard to potential risk factors for toxicity. RESULTS: A total of 50 patients were included, 6 (12$) of whom had radiographic and/or clinical symptoms concerning for T-DM1-induced pneumonitis. All 6 patients had metastatic or unresectable breast cancer. Of the 6 patients, 5 (83$) had suspected pulmonary metastases, 1 (17$) had a history of underlying lung disease, and 5 (83$) had a history of prior taxane therapy. Pulmonary metastases (p = 0.38), the median number of treatment cycles (p = 0.29), prior taxane therapy (p = 0.99), underlying lung disease (p = 0.99), and hormone receptor positivity (p = 0.66) did not have any statistical significance for an association with pneumonitis. CONCLUSION: Pneumonitis is a recognized toxic effect of T-DM1. While our sample size was small, the number of events was higher than described in the literature, which may be an artifact of referral bias. Future studies with a larger sample population may detect potential risk factors for toxicity.',\n",

Tear samples were collected once prior to and again within 30 minutes following the end of the 1-hour docetaxel infusion. A blood sample was also obtained after infusion. The tear and plasma samples were analyzed for drug content using high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Docetaxel was found in the tear samples collected from all 6 patients.

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Induction docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil (TPF) chemotherapy followed by definitive concurrent chemoradiation remains the standard of care in locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck cancers despite which the survival remains low. So, we analyzed the efficacy and adverse effect profile of the addition of nimotuzumab to standard TPF induction chemotherapy. Methods. We included 20 patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Patients were administered with induction chemotherapy with nimotuzumab plus docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil (TPF\\u2009+\\u2009N) followed by definitive concurrent chemoradiation with carboplatin. Treatment responses were assessed by PET-CT following induction chemotherapy and concurrent chemoradiation. Response rates, survival, and adverse effects data were tabulated and analyzed using the Kaplan Meier method. RESULTS: At a minimum follow-up of two years, the median progression-free survival (PFS) and median overall survival (OS) were 16 months and 38 months, respectively. PFS and OS were not reached (NR) in patients who showed a complete radiological response (CR). Median PFS and OS in patients who had partial response were 17.6 and 34.5\\u2009months, respectively. All subsites of primary including oral cavity, hypopharynx, and oropharynx showed similar response rates and survival. Overall the treatment was well tolerated with predominantly grade 1/2 toxicities. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer could possibly have a better response and survival with nimotuzumab added to the standard TPF regimen. A complete response may serve as a good surrogate for survival irrespective of the primary site of head and neck cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Fruquintinib, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor, is a new anticancer drug independently developed in China to treat refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). In Japan, regorafenib combined with nivolumab has been demonstrated to be promising in patients with refractory mCRC. Here, in a real-world study, we were aimed to evaluate the efficacy of fruquintinib with various programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors after standard treatment in Chinese non-microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H)/mismatch repair proficient mCRC patients. METHODS: A total of 45 patients with refractory mCRC were involved in the study. They received fruquintinib (3 or 5 mg, orally administered once a day for 3 weeks followed by 1 week off in 4-week cycles) and a PD-1 inhibitor(200 mg pembrolizumab, 3 mg/kg nivolumab, 200 mg sintilimab or camrelizumab, intravenously administered on D1 once every 3 weeks). Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR), and objective response rate (ORR) were reviewed and evaluated. RESULTS: Among the 45 patients, the median age was 54 years (29-85). The ORR was 11.1% (5/45), DCR 62.2% (28/45), median PFS equal 3.8 months, and median OS was 14.9 months. The response duration was 3.4 months. PFS between left and right primary tumors and PFS with or without lung metastases were both not significantly different (p > 0.05), which was inconsistent with the result of REGONIVO study. The multivariate analysis indicated no association of OS benefit in the specified subgroups. No adverse-effect-related deaths were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Fruquintinib, in combination with anti-PD-1, was observed to have clinical activity in a small population of patients with heavily pretreated mCRC in our center. Further studies are needed to verify this outcome in a large population.',\n",

       "  'AB': '(111)In-nuclear localization sequence-trastuzumab is a radioimmunotherapeutic agent consisting of trastuzumab modified with NLS peptides (CGYGPKKKRKVGG) and labeled with the Auger electron emitter (111)In. Our objectives were to evaluate the tumor growth-inhibitory properties and normal-tissue toxicity of (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab in mice after intraperitoneal administration. METHODS: The pharmacokinetics of (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab after intravenous (tail vein) or intraperitoneal injection in BALB/c mice were compared. Normal-tissue toxicity was determined in BALB/c mice at 2 wk after intraperitoneal injection of 3.7-18.5 MBq (4 mg/kg) of (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab by monitoring body weight, histopathologic examination of tissues, and hematology (white blood cell, platelet, red blood cell, and hemoglobin) or clinical biochemistry (alanine transaminase and creatinine) parameters. A no-observable-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) dose was defined. Athymic mice bearing subcutaneous MDA-MB-361 or MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer xenografts (5.0 x 10(5) or 0.5 x 10(5) HER2/cell, respectively) were treated with a single NOAEL dose or 2 doses administered intraperitoneally and separated by 2 wk. Control groups were administered (111)In-trastuzumab, trastuzumab, nonspecific (111)In-NLS-human IgG (hIgG), or normal saline. RESULTS: The bioavailability of (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab after intraperitoneal injection was 0.7. The NOAEL dose was 9.25 MBq (4 mg/kg); doses greater than or equal to 18.5 MBq decreased white blood cell or platelet counts, and doses of 27.7 MBq decreased red blood cell counts. There was no increase in alanine transaminase or creatinine at any doses tested. There were no morphologic changes to the liver, kidneys, heart, or spleen or loss of body weight. A single dose of (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab (9.25 MBq)-compared with mice receiving (111)In-trastuzumab, trastuzumab, (111)In-NLS-hIgG, or normal saline-significantly slowed the rate of growth of MDA-MB-361 tumors over 60 d (0.014 d(-1) vs. 0.033 d(-1), 0.046 d(-1), 0.030 d(-1), and 0.061 d(-1), respectively; P < 0.05). (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab had no effect on the growth of MDA-MB-231 tumors. Two doses of (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab (9.25 MBq; 4 mg/kg) separated by 2 wk increased the survival of mice with MDA-MB-361 tumors, compared with mice treated with trastuzumab or normal saline (>140 d vs. 96 and 84 d, respectively; P < 0.001 or 0.027, respectively). CONCLUSION: (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab is a promising radioimmunotherapeutic agent that could be effective for treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer in humans.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'CT-P6 is a biosimilar of trastuzumab and is recommended to be administered for 30-90\\u2009min in subsequent maintenance infusions to prevent infusion-related reactions (IRRs). We administered CT-P6 for 30\\u2009min as the first injection and as an alternative to reference trastuzumab in the maintenance infusion and evaluated the safety of the administration. A total of 140 patients with breast or gastric cancer, who received a switch from tri-weekly reference trastuzumab to CT-P6 for 30\\u2009min in maintenance infusions, were retrospectively evaluated. Premedication was administered prior to an infusion of CT-P6 and a cytotoxic agent. However, premedication was not provided when CT-P6 was co-administered with pertuzumab or administered alone. The primary endpoint was the incidence of IRRs. The secondary endpoint was the incidence of diarrhea and skin toxicity. Ninety-five percent of the patients had breast cancer, and 44.3% had advance-stage cancer. The treatment included CT-P6 alone (17.9%) or with cytotoxic agents (23.6%), antihormonal drugs (25.7%), and pertuzumab (62.9%). Median administration time of trastuzumab at the switch was 13 administrations (range 2-140). Premedication was administered to 20.7% patients. One patient (0.7%) experienced grade 3 IRR. The frequency of diarrhea in the reference trastuzumab group and the CT-P6 group was 7.1 and 6.4%, respectively, and that of skin toxicity was 6.4 and 5.0%, respectively, without differences. In conclusion, we first demonstrated that an initial CT-P6 administration for 30\\u2009min during the switch from reference trastuzumab in maintenance infusion is an acceptable administration method.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy, including preoperative chemotherapy, plays an important role in the treatment of esophageal cancer. However, although docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (DCF) therapy has a powerful antitumor effect, the associated adverse events make it difficult to maintain the patient's general condition. Oral mucositis is an important adverse effect of chemotherapy, and its severity, frequency, and impact on patient quality of life should not be underestimated. This study evaluated the role of oral cryotherapy for prophylaxis of oral mucositis caused by DCF therapy. METHODS: We retrospectively examined the incidence and severity of adverse events, including mucositis, in 72 patients with esophageal cancer treated with DCF. Fifty-eight patients received cryotherapy during docetaxel administration and 14 received no cryotherapy. RESULTS: The incidence of mucositis of all grades and grade 3 was significantly lower in the cryotherapy group compared with the no-cryotherapy group (24.1% vs. 71.4%, P\\u2009<\\u20090.001 and 0% vs. 28.6%, P\\u2009=\\u20090.001, respectively). The incidence of anorexia of all grades and grade 3 was also significantly lower in the cryotherapy group (22.4% vs. 57.1%, P\\u2009=\\u20090.037 and 0% vs. 28.6%, P\\u2009=\\u20090.010, respectively). CONCLUSION: Adjunctive oral cryotherapy is effective for the prophylaxis and relief of oral mucositis and anorexia caused by chemotherapy.\",\n",

Moreover, chemotherapy agents are known to typically cause thrombocytopenia by suppressing haematopoiesis, but they can also cause immune thrombocytopenia in which the mechanism involves antibody-mediated platelet destruction. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of severe thrombocytopenia related to trastuzumab administration in which the patient exhibits a slow drift downward in platelet counts with repeated cycles of trastuzumab. A 70-year-old woman received a diagnosis of breast cancer and was treated with trastuzumab. She was confirmed to have a severe trastuzumab-induced thrombocytopenia after the 4th cycle. Retreatment with trastuzumab was not attempted. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Considering that trastuzumab is being increasingly used and that severe thrombocytopenia is a potentially life-threatening complication, its association must be seriously considered.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: The docetaxel, 5-fluorouracil, and cisplatin (DCF) regimen is an effective form of chemotherapy for advanced esophageal cancer. However, the incidence of adverse events such as febrile neutropenia and hematological toxicity is high. METHODS: Among 937 patients with esophageal cancer at Toranomon Hospital between January 2011 and December 2018, 92 who underwent the DCF regimen as initial treatment were selected. We investigated the risk factors for febrile neutropenia in patients with esophageal cancer treated with DCF regimen and the effectiveness of pegfilgrastim as primary prophylaxis. RESULTS: Adverse events (CTCAE grade ≥\\u20093) were observed in 45 of the 92(48.9%) patients with esophageal cancer treated with an initial DCF regimen. Febrile neutropenia was observed in 20 (21.7%) patients. Non-use of pegfilgrastim (odds ratio\\u2009=\\u200916.393; 95% confidence interval 2.049-125.0) as primary prophylaxis was identified as an independent factor predictive of febrile neutropenia. The pegfilgrastim group had a significantly lower incidence of neutropenia than the control group (9.1% vs 61.0%; p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). The incidence of febrile neutropenia was 3.0% in the pegfilgrastim group and 32.2% in the control group (p\\u2009=\\u20090.001). In addition, the incidence of any adverse effect ≥\\u2009CTCAE grade3 was also significantly lower in the pegfilgrastim group (12.1% vs 69.5%; p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). The reduced/interruption rate of next DCF therapy was 6.1% in the pegfilgrastim group and 30.5% in the control group (p\\u2009=\\u20090.006). CONCLUSION: This study revealed that the non-use of pegfilgrastim was an independent factor predictive of febrile neutropenia in multivariate analysis. Pegfilgrastim as primary prophylaxis prevents severe neutropenia and febrile neutropenia in patients with esophageal cancer treated with the DCF regimen.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'The results of four phase II studies of docetaxel in cancers of the gastrointestinal tract are summarized. No prior chemotherapy was permitted except for adjuvant chemotherapy completed at least 1 year before entering the present study. In all studies, docetaxel was administered at a dose of 100 mg/m2 given by intravenous infusion over 1 h once every 3 weeks, adjusted according to toxicity. Routine premedication for hypersensitivity reactions was given to most patients in the US study in colorectal cancer but not to patients in the three European studies in gastric, pancreatic and colorectal cancers. In a European Organization for Research on Treatment of Cancer--Early Clinical Trials Group (EORTC-ECTG) study in gastric cancer, 8 (24%) of 33 evaluable patients achieved partial remissions lasting for a median of 7.5 months. Responses occurred in a variety of metastatic sites. Forty-two patients were evaluable in a French study of docetaxel in pancreatic cancer. Partial responses were achieved in 6 (20%) of 30 patients with metastatic disease and 3 of 12 patients with loco-regional disease showed some improvement. Two studies in colorectal cancer--one European and one US--found that docetaxel had little or no activity in these patients. Three (9%) of 33 evaluable patients in the European study achieved responses (one complete and two partial) and none of 19 patients in the US study. Hematological toxicity was the dose-limiting adverse effect. Acute hypersensitivity reactions and fluid retention also occurred in some patients. In conclusion, docetaxel appears to be as effective as standard single-agent therapies for gastric and pancreatic cancers but to have minimal effect in colorectal carcinoma. Toxicities were generally manageable; premedication with corticosteroids may reduce the incidence and severity of acute hypersensitivity reactions and delay the onset of fluid retention.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: Maintaining dose-intensity with chemotherapeutic agents is hindered by a number of adverse effects including asthenia/fatigue. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is one of the cytokines responsible for the fatigue and cachexia associated with malignancies. We used etanercept (TNF-decoy receptor) to maintain dose-intensity of weekly docetaxel. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Initially, 12 patients with advanced malignancies were randomly assigned to either docetaxel 43 mg/m2 weekly alone (cohort A) or the same docetaxel dose plus etanercept 25 mg subcutaneously twice weekly (cohort B). Subsequently, higher doses of docetaxel in combination with etanercept were evaluated. Pharmacokinetics (PKs), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation, and intracellular cytokines levels were measured. Patients completed weekly questionnaires quantifying asthenia/fatigue. RESULTS: Twenty-nine of 36 intended docetaxel doses during the first cycle were delivered in cohort A, and 35 of 36 doses were delivered in cohort B (P = .055). Three cohort B patients received additional cycles in the absence of disease progression or severe toxicity, whereas no patients from cohort A received additional cycles. Escalation to docetaxel 52 mg/m2 weekly with etanercept resulted in neutropenia, not fatigue, as the limiting adverse effect, and the addition of filgrastim permitted the maintenance of dose-intensity in additional patients. Patients randomly selected to receive etanercept/docetaxel self-reported less fatigue (P < .001), and docetaxel PKs show no relevant influence of etanercept. NF-kappaB activation and increased expression of TNF-alpha were associated with increments in docetaxel dose. Antitumor activity was noticed exclusively in patients receiving etanercept. CONCLUSION: The addition of etanercept is safe and had no impact on docetaxel concentrations. The significant improvement in tolerability and the trend toward preservation of dose-intensity suggests further exploration of TNF blockade as an adjunct to cancer therapies.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) can be a debilitating and dose-limiting adverse effect of chemotherapy. Comprehensive self-report tools for CIPN are needed for research and clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this psychometric study was to describe the development and evaluate the reliability and validity of a new self-report tool designed to measure CIPN, the Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy Assessment Tool (CIPNAT). METHODS: One hundred sixty-seven patients receiving outpatient chemotherapy with paclitaxel, docetaxel, cisplatin, or oxaliplatin completed the CIPNAT. Content validity, convergent validity, discriminant validity, test-retest reliability, and internal consistency reliability were assessed. RESULTS: Content validity index was very acceptable at 0.95. Convergent validity data were provided by correlation with a measure of the same concept (r = 0.83, P < .001), and differences between contrasting groups (t = 7.66, P < .001) provided evidence of discriminant validity. High test-retest correlations (r = 0.92, P < .001), Cronbach α (α = .95), and significant item-to-total correlations ranging from 0.38 to 0.70 provided evidence of reliability. CONCLUSIONS: Results provide evidence of the validity and reliability of the CIPNAT, which can be used for comprehensive assessment of CIPN. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Use of the CIPNAT in research may lead to a better understanding of CIPN and guide nurses in developing and testing of interventions to relieve suffering and enhance quality of life for patients with CIPN.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'WNT5A is abnormally increased in a variety of cancers including breast cancer and has an adverse effect on the prognosis. However, the biological function of WNT5A is not fully known in HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer. Using public clinical data, we analyzed disease-free survival (DFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). Here, we found that abnormal WNT5A induction is a correlation with the poor prognosis of HER2+ breast cancer. WNT5A expression was also decreased by pan-HER inhibitor neratinib but not by trastuzumab. In addition, WNT5A augmented cell invasiveness of HER2+ breast-cancer cells. To find WNT5A-induced metastatic-related factors, we did a human cytokine array. The levels of GM-CSF and CXCL8 were significantly increased by WNT5A. CXCL8 also accelerated cell invasiveness in HCC1954 breast-cancer cells. The expression of CXCL8 induced by WNT5A has been significantly reduced by MEK inhibitor, binimetinib. Finally, we studied the effect of CXCR2 antagonist, SB225002, to verify the relevance of CXCL8 in WNT5A-induced cell invasion. As expected, we found that WNT5A-induced cell invasion is completely inhibited by SB225002. Taken together, we have demonstrated that WNT5A directly mediates cell invasion through the induction of CXCL8 and ultimately affects the survival rate of HER2+ breast cancer.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of cisplatin, fluorouracil, and docetaxel chemotherapy plus intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). METHODS: Sixty patients with locoregionally advanced NPC were enrolled. Patients received IMRT plus three courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and two courses of adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel (60 mg/m(2)/day on day 1), cisplatin (25 mg/m(2)/day on days 1-3), and 5-fluorouracil (500 mg/m(2)/day on days 1-3). RESULTS: The overall response rate to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was 89 %. Three months after the completion of radiotherapy, 53 (93 %) patients achieved complete regression, 3 (5 %) achieved partial response (PR), and 1 experienced liver metastasis. However, among the 3 PR patients, 2 patients had no evidence of relapse in the follow-up. With a median follow-up of 27 months (range, 6-43), the 2-year estimated locoregional failure-free survival, distant failure-free survival, progression-free survival, and overall survival were 96.6, 93.3, 89.9, and 98.3 %, respectively. Leukopenia was the main adverse effect in chemotherapy; 14 patients experienced grade 3 or grade 4 neutropenia, and 1 patient developed febrile neutropenia. The nonhematological adverse events included alopecia, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and diarrhea. The incidence of grade 3 acute radiotherapy-related mucositis was 28.3 %; no grade 4 acute mucositis was observed. No grade 3 or grade 4 hematological toxicity occurred during radiotherapy. None of the patients had interrupted radiotherapy. The common late adverse effects included xerostomia and hearing impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant-adjuvant chemotherapy using cisplatin, fluorouracil, plus docetaxel combined with IMRT was an effective and well-tolerated alternative for advanced NPC.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'A 75-year-old man underwent distal gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer in September 2018. During the adjuvant chemotherapy, computed tomography (CT) revealed recurrence sites in the liver and para-aortic lymph nodes. Therefore, chemotherapy was initiated. After first-line (capecitabine with oxaliplatin) and second-line (paclitaxel with ramucirumab) treatments, nivolumab was used as third-line chemotherapy. This treatment showed a strong effect against the tumor. However, following an immune-related adverse effect (irAE) because of nivolumab, the therapy was halted. The irAE was diagnosed with central adrenal insufficiency that was controllable by oral intake of steroids. CPT-11 was started and showed a similarly strong effect to that observed for nivolumab. Eventually, the recurrent tumor lesions became too small to be detected by CT. We discontinued CPT-11 at the request of the patient. Even after discontinuation, no recurrent sites have been observed, allowing us to declare a case of clinical complete response (cCR). In conclusion, even if irAEs occur in a patient, continuing chemotherapy should be considered. However, if cCR is achieved, discontinuation of chemotherapy might be a strategic treatment option.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVES: Docetaxel is an inhibitor of microtubule depolymerization and has demonstrated activity in paclitaxel-resistant breast cancer and gynecologic cancer. The Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) conducted a study of docetaxel in paclitaxel-resistant ovarian and peritoneal carcinoma to determine its activity, and nature and degree of toxicity, in this cohort of patients. METHODS: Patients with platinum- and paclitaxel-resistant ovarian or peritoneal carcinoma, defined as progression while on or within 6 months of therapy, were eligible if they had measurable disease and had not received more than one chemotherapy regimen. Docetaxel at a dose of 100 mg/m(2) was administered iv over 1 h every 21 days. A prophylactic regimen of oral dexamethasone 8 mg bid was begun 24 h before docetaxel administration and continued for 48 h thereafter. Hepatic function was strictly monitored. RESULTS: Sixty patients were entered and treated with a total of 256 courses, with all 60 evaluable for toxicity and 58 evaluable for response. Responses were observed in 22.4% of patients, with 5.2% achieving complete response and 17.2% achieving partial response (95% CI, 12.5-35.3%). The median duration of response was 2.5 months. The likelihood of observing a response did not appear to be related to the length of the prior paclitaxel-free interval or duration of prior paclitaxel infusions. The principal adverse effect of grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 75% of patients. There was one treatment-related death. Dose reductions were required in 36% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Docetaxel is active in paclitaxel-resistant ovarian and peritoneal cancer but, in view of significant hematologic toxicity, further study is warranted to ascertain its optimal dose and schedule.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Pegfilgrastim (PEG) is a sustained-duration pegylated form of filgrastim, a granulocyte-colony stimulating factor agent that is widely used as prophylaxis against febrile neutropenia during chemotherapy. We report the case of a breast cancer patient who developed PEG-induced vasculitis complicated by subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and review the relevant literature. CASE PRESENTATION: A 48-year-old woman had undergone surgery for breast cancer and was receiving docetaxel and cyclophosphamide as adjuvant chemotherapy (docetaxel 75\\xa0mg/m(2), cyclophosphamide 600\\xa0mg/m(2)); on day 4 of treatment, PEG had been administered. On day 14, she was admitted to hospital with fever, general malaise, and neck pain, and her C-reactive protein level was found to be high (12.65\\xa0mg/dL). Although infection was initially suspected, antimicrobial treatment was ineffective and other laboratory test results were negative for this. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography on day 22 showed thickened vessel walls in the left subclavian artery, the origin of the common carotid artery, and the thoracoabdominal aorta. On day 26, magnetic resonance imaging of the head to investigate possible causes of headache showed signs consistent with SAH, and magnetic resonance angiography images showed irregularity in the basilar artery wall; the findings of both studies were considered to be due to PEG-induced vasculitis. Once treatment with prednisolone 40\\xa0mg/day had started, the wall thickening and irregularity improved. CONCLUSION: Although an uncommon adverse effect, vasculitis affecting vessels of various sizes may be caused by PEG. To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first to describe a case of G-CSF-induced vasculitis complicated by SAH. In cases of persistent high fever and elevated inflammatory response after PEG administration and in the absence of infection, clinicians should consider the possibility of drug-induced vasculitis.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Lenvatinib-pembrolizumab combination (LEAP) is an approved therapy in Japan for advanced endometrial cancer, based on the data from the KEYNOTE-775 clinical trial. We report a case of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) in a patient who received LEAP therapy for advanced endometrial cancer. CASE PRESENTATION: A 53-year-old patient with stage IVB endometrial cancer having rectal metastases, after four cycles of paclitaxel-carboplatin therapy, was found to have increased rectal invasion, peritoneal dissemination, and multiple paraaortic lymph node metastases. She was treated with LEAP therapy and discharged on day 12 without adverse events, except for mild anemia on day 11 of treatment. She was carefully managed in the outpatient department, but on day 18, she was admitted to the emergency department with severely impaired consciousness and generalized seizures. Computed tomography of the head and lumbar tap showed no abnormal findings, and the seizures resolved with anticonvulsant medication alone. Based on a thorough physical examination and findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which showed high signal intensity in the left occipital lobe, encephalopathy, rather than encephalitis, was the likely diagnosis. Symptomatic improvement was observed, and pembrolizumab monotherapy was resumed. CONCLUSIONS: If consciousness is impaired during LEAP treatment, it is necessary to differentiate between immunogenic encephalitis caused by pembrolizumab or encephalopathy caused by lenvatinib. MRI and lumbar tap can help in distinguishing between the two and diagnosing the responsible drug.',\n",

Previous research primarily focused on the monoclonal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody bevacizumab and its adverse outcomes. Reports show a higher risk of ischemic stroke, one of the most concerning clinically relevant events, after treatment with bevacizumab. However, few studies have examined the relationship between anti-VEGF receptor 2 monoclonal antibody ramucirumab and its adverse events. This article presents the case of a non-small-cell lung cancer patient who experienced a new ischemic stroke after treatment with ramucirumab.

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: The efficacy of second line chemotherapy for relapsed non small cell lung cancer has been established. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of maintenance therapy with docetaxel in patients with non-small cell lung cancer who were stabilized with first line chemotherapy and had good performance status before relapse. The primary objective was to determine one-year survival and the other objectives were evaluation of adverse effects and time to progression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen patients with lung cancer were included in this study. All patients were at stage III and IV, without distant metastasis or neuropathy. All patients had been treated with platinum based regimen initially and were responsive or stable with no progression. The patients were treated with docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) for a total of 4 cycles repeated every 3 weeks. RESULTS: All patients accomplished 4 chemotherapy cycles and a total of 72 cycles were administered. The mean time of progression free survival (PFS) was 9-10 months and one- year survival (OS) was 94.4% without any significant adverse effect necessitating medical intervention. The mean survival time of patients was 18 (12-20) months. CONCLUSION: Using docetaxel as consolidation chemotherapy in patients with non small cell lung cancer can prolong time to progression of disease and probably patients' survival without significant adverse effects or negative impact on the quality of life.\",\n",

Rarely, this\\xa0therapy can cause adverse cardiovascular effects such as cardiac dysfunction, arrhythmias and hypertension. We report a case of a 60-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department with an episode of hypertensive emergency. She had been recently diagnosed with hypertension which was found to be poorly controlled. The recent administration of trastuzumab together with this hypertensive episode led us to suspect trastuzumab as the cause for this rise in her blood pressure. With this case we intend to raise awareness of hypertension, a potentially preventable condition, as an adverse effect of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 targeted therapies such as trastuzumab. Additionally we propose an appropriate\\xa0and careful management of arterial hypertension among those receiving this first-in-class drug.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'INTRODUCTION: Immune-related hepatitis is an adverse effect following treatment with immune-checkpoint inhibitors, such as ipilimumab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab. International guidelines advise on the use of corticosteroids as first-line treatment, although guidance on how to treat cases resistant to corticosteroids is limited. We aimed to evaluate the presentation and management of patients with grade 3-4 immune-related hepatitis, following treatment with immune-checkpoint inhibitors for stage 4 or unresectable or stage 3 melanoma, with a particular focus on steroid-refractory cases. METHODS: A retrospective observational review of patients developing immune-related hepatitis whilst undergoing treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors for advanced melanoma from July 2014 to February 2020 at a tertiary oncology centre. RESULTS: Forty-one patients developed immune-related hepatitis, of which 83% had been treated with the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab. The median time to onset of IR-hepatitis was 47 days (range: 4-476), and the median time to peak alanine aminotransferase was 71 days (range: 4-478). Four patients had resolution of grade 3 immune-related hepatitis without the introduction of corticosteroids. A total of 37 patients were treated with corticosteroids. A total of 12 required oral treatment only and 13 were successfully managed as outpatients. Six patients had steroid-refractory immune-related hepatitis; and all received tacrolimus, with one also receiving mycophenolate mofetil and infliximab. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the largest UK series of immune-related hepatitis patients in the literature. We present two important deviations from current guidelines. Firstly, there is some evidence that withholding steroids is possible in grade 3-4 immune-related hepatitis. Secondly, tacrolimus can be used successfully to manage patients resistant to corticosteroids, with the early introduction most beneficial to reduce time on steroids.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Second-line treatment for urothelial carcinoma (UC) patients is used if progression or failure after platinum-based chemotherapy occurs or if patients are cisplatin-unfit. However, there is still no widely accepted treatment strategy. We aimed to analyze the effectiveness and safety of second-line treatment strategies for UC patients. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that included UC patients who were cisplatin-ineligible or unfit up to April 19, 2019. The primary outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and objective response rate (ORR). RESULTS: Thirteen trials that assessed 3502 UC patients were included. This study divided the network comparisons into three parts. The first part contained studies comparing taxanes and other interventions; the second part assessed investigator's choice chemotherapy (ICC)-related comparisons; and the third part assessed best support care (BSC). In the OS results of the first part, pembrolizumab (87.5%), ramucirumab plus docetaxel (74.6%), and atezolizumab (71.1%) had a relative advantage. Pembrolizumab also had advantages in ORR and severe adverse effect (SAE) results. Vinflunine and ramucirumab plus docetaxel had a relatively high surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) rank by exploratory cluster analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This study concluded that atezolizumab and pembrolizumab are superior to other treatments, mainly in OS results, but no treatment confers a significant advantage in PFS. Pembrolizumab still has relative advantages in ORR and SAE results compared to ICC. Due to limitations, more studies are necessary to confirm the conclusions.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'INTRODUCTION: Salivary gland neoplasms (SGNs) respond poorly to the traditional chemotherapy agents limiting the availability of systemic treatment options in the metastatic setting. The recent identification of actionable molecular targets in SGNs has led to the evaluation of targeted therapies in non-approved advanced SGNs. CASE REPORT: We present the case of an elderly male with HER-2 Neu overexpressing metastatic mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) who demonstrated a prompt and sustained disease response to targeted therapies directed against HER-2 Neu with long survival interrupted by hepatoxicity to Trastuzumab emtansine (TDM-1) treatment.Management and Outcome: The patient was started on Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab on a clinical trial and resulted in an objective improvement sustained over 3 years. Following the disease progression, TDM-1 was started with a response until the patient developed severe hepatotoxicity as an adverse effect of TDM-1 therapy resulting in its discontinuation. Close follow-up post-treatment-discontinuation demonstrated continued clinical improvement until 6 months, when the patient developed brain metastasis. He passed away a few months later in hospice care. DISCUSSION: The metastatic MEC in our patient overexpressed HER-2 Neu. Owing to Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab response, Trastuzumab emtansine (TDM-1) was initiated on a compassionate basis which further extended the survival but had to be terminated owing to adverse effects. Given the paucity of data on targeted therapies in the treatment of metastatic SGNs and the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of TDM-1 therapy among the elderly, further studies are warranted to answer these important questions and to identify eligible patients for this novel treatment option.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'STUDY OBJECTIVE: Cancer immunotherapy is evolving rapidly and is transforming cancer care. During the last decade, immune checkpoint therapies have been developed to enhance the immune response; however, specific adverse effects related to autoimmunity are increasingly apparent. This study aims to fill the knowledge gap related to the spectrum of immune-related adverse effects among cancer patients visiting emergency departments (EDs). METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients treated with immune checkpoint therapy who visited the ED of a comprehensive cancer center between March 1, 2011, and February 29, 2016. Immune-related adverse effects from the ED visits were identified and profiled. We analyzed the association of each immune-related adverse effect with overall survival from the ED visit to death. RESULTS: We identified 1,026 visits for 628 unique patients; of these, 257 visits (25.0%) were related to one or more immune-related adverse effects. Diarrhea was the most common one leading to an ED visit. The proportions of ED visits associated with\\xa0diarrhea, hypophysitis, thyroiditis, pancreatitis, or hepatitis varied significantly by immune checkpoint therapy agent. Colitis was significantly associated with better prognosis, whereas pneumonitis was significantly associated with worse survival. CONCLUSION: Cancer patients treated with ipilimumab, nivolumab, or pembrolizumab may have a spectrum of immune-related adverse effects that require emergency care. Future studies will need to update this profile as further novel immunotherapeutic agents are added.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVE: To describe the surgical treatment and outcomes in patients with metastatic breast cancer and canalicular stenosis caused by weekly treatment with docetaxel. METHODS: This case series included 10 patients with persistent epiphora due to weekly docetaxel treatment, who were evaluated by probing and irrigation of the tear drainage apparatus and were found to have significant canalicular stenosis. The severity of canalicular stenosis was graded clinically. Each patient underwent bicanalicular silicone intubation or dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) with placement of either a silicone tube (canaliculo DCR) or a pyrex glass tube (conjunctivo DCR). RESULTS: Seven patients (12 eyes) underwent bicanalicular silicone intubation. Three patients (5 eyes) required canaliculo DCR with the placement of a silicone tube. In 2 patients (3 eyes), the degree of canalicular stenosis was severe enough to require conjunctivo DCR with the placement of a pyrex glass tube. All 10 patients had complete resolution of epiphora immediately after surgery. Four patients continued to receive docetaxel after surgery. In patients who underwent bicanalicular silicone intubation, the silicone stent was kept in place for the duration of docetaxel therapy. There were no surgical or anesthesia-related complications. At a mean follow-up time of 9 months after surgery, all but 1 patient (1 eye) remained asymptomatic. The interval between initiation of docetaxel therapy and surgery was significantly higher in patients who required DCR compared with those who had silicone intubation. The mean cumulative dose of docetaxel at the time of surgery was higher in patients who required DCR than in patients who had silicone intubation, but this difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Canalicular stenosis secondary to weekly treatment with docetaxel should be treated with bicanalicular silicone intubation early in the course of docetaxel therapy. Failure to treat this adverse effect early may likely lead to severe and irreversible canalicular stenosis, which may necessitate conjunctivo DCR with the placement of a permanent pyrex glass tube.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Chemotherapy with docetaxel remains the effective therapy to suppress castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in some patients. However, most chemotherapy with docetaxel eventually fails with the development of docetaxel resistance after 18-weeks of treatment. Here we found docetaxel treatment might have an adverse effect of increasing the androgen receptor (AR) protein level in the CRPC cells, and combining docetaxel with anti-AR therapy using AR-shRNA or the AR degradation enhancer ASC-J9® may increase docetaxel sensitivity to better suppress the CRPC cell growth. Mechanism dissection found docetaxel might have the adverse effect of increasing the AR protein stability via suppressing the AR ubiquitination due to the increased AR phosphorylation. The consequence of such increased AR protein may then lead to increase p21 expression via transcriptional regulation. Preclinical studies with in vitro cells lines also demonstrated that targeting AR with ASC-J9® led to suppressing the AR-increased p21 expression to improve the docetaxel sensitivity in the CRPC cells that already developed docetaxel resistance. Together, these results suggest that a combined therapy of docetaxel and ASC-J9® is a novel therapy to better suppress CRPC in patients that already developed docetaxel resistance.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'One common adverse effect following breast-conservation surgery and adjuvant radiation is lymphedema. While lymphedema of the arm has been well-characterized, there has been less investigation into lymphedema of the breast. We sought to characterize rates of breast lymphedema (BLE) in women with early-stage breast cancer and identify potential predictors in its development. Two hundred and thirty consecutive patients treated with lumpectomy and adjuvant whole breast radiation therapy (WBRT) from January 2016 - June 2017 were included. All patients were seen in our lymphedema monitoring clinic for baseline and at least one follow-up lymphedema measurement. BLE grades were assigned by trained nurses in the lymphedema clinic. Data regarding patient demographic and treatment factors were extracted from the electronic medical record. Comparisons between groups were made using Chi-Square analysis performed in SAS. The median age of the sample was 62 (range 31-90). Median follow-up from surgery was 15.3 months. Forty-three patients were diagnosed with lymphedema of the breast (18.7%). Rates of grade 1 and 2 BLE were 93% and 7%, respectively; there were no cases of severe lymphedema. Sixty-three percent of cases resolved by last follow-up with treatment recommendations. There was no association between development of BLE and patient factors investigated, including age, T stage, radiation dose and fractionation, lymph node biopsy, number of lymph nodes removed, development of arm lymphedema, and use of chemotherapy. Tumor subtype was found to be significant (P = 0.04) and there was a trend towards significance for receipt of trastuzumab (P = 0.09). BLE is a distinct entity from arm lymphedema and is a common finding in women treated with breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant WBRT. It is a generally mild and self-limiting process. There were no treatment or patient-related factors that correlated with increased risk of lymphedema development in our sample except for HER-2 positive disease and receipt of trastuzamab.',\n",

       "  'PG': '444-50',\n",
       "  'AB': 'AIMS: Since the release of Herceptin, pathology laboratories have been requested to test breast carcinomas for HER-2/neu overexpression and/or gene amplification. Standardized IHC and FISH are mandatory in order to get reliable results, but there are problems even with standardized procedures. We decided to evaluate the two methods to determine which, or possibly if both, should be the primary investigation method(s). METHODS AND RESULTS: The material consisted of 215 primary invasive breast carcinomas with complete clinical follow-up of 15 years. HER-2/neu protein expression was determined for all specimens, whereas FISH for assessing HER-2/neu gene signal number was done in 165 cases. IHC was double-checked with two or three different antibodies in 35 tumours, including all cases with discrepancies between IHC and FISH. Among these, there were discrepancies in a third. IHC overexpression of HER-2/neu was found in 13% and gene amplification in 18%. Discordance between IHC and FISH was found in 11 cases (8%). Five tumours were IHC+/FISH- and six were IHC-/FISH+. IHC and FISH positive cases as well as FISH only positive tumours had the same prognosis respecting survival. Tumours with >2 but <or=4 HER-2 gene signals per nucleus had the same survival as cases with >4 gene signals per nucleus. In contrast, cases with IHC overexpression without gene amplification had a prognosis similar to that of IHC-/FISH- tumours. CONCLUSIONS: From our data, it seems to be more important to assess HER-2/neu gene amplification than IHC overexpression. Failure to detect FISH-amplified (IHC-negative) cases would have an adverse effect on the survival of these patients. On the other hand, IHC overexpression tumours without gene amplification appear to belong to a better prognostic group, and failure to detect them would probably not have a negative effect on the survival of these women. Even though FISH is a more complex and expensive procedure, it should be considered the method of choice for primary assessment of HER-2/neu status in breast cancer patients.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Pembrolizumab is a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) inhibitor that has been approved for treatment of a wide variety of malignancies. Immune-mediated colitis is a known but uncommon adverse effect of pembrolizumab. Symptoms of immune-mediated colitis can be similar to those of many other gastrointestinal illnesses, including Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). If not recognized and treated in a timely fashion, immune-mediated colitis can lead to significant morbidity in cancer patients. We report the case of a 56-year-old woman on pembrolizumab for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented with severe colitis symptoms and initially tested positive for CDI. Her colitis symptoms worsened despite appropriate treatment for CDI but later improved rapidly after systemic corticosteroid was started for suspected immune-mediated colitis. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of concurrent pembrolizumab-induced colitis and CDI. Immune-mediated colitis should be considered in the differential diagnoses in patients on pembrolizumab or other immune checkpoint inhibitors who present with colitis symptoms, even when a concurrent infectious etiology is suspected.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'The aim of this study was to compare the clinical efficacy of pemetrexed+cisplatin (PP) versus docetaxel+cisplatin (DP) for the treatment of stage IV lung adenocarcinoma. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 147 patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma treated between January 2011 and December 2015, 100 of which were in the DP group whereas 47 were in the DP group. Main inclusion criteria were treatment-naive patients, first-line treatment with PP or DP with no molecular targeted therapy during treatment, 2-6 cycles of first-line chemotherapy with unknown status of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation, 18-75 years of age, and Karnofsky performance status score of at least 70. Prognostic factors for survival were identified by using univariate and multivariate analyses. Propensity score matching was performed to further adjust for confounding. A total of 47 pairs were successfully matched between the two groups. The median overall survival was 9.0 months in the DP group and 17.0 months in the PP group; the 1-year survival rate was 29.8 and 59.6%, respectively; the 2-year survival rate was 12.8 and 21.1%, respectively (χ=4.128, P=0.042); and median progression-free survival was 6.0 and 8.0 months, respectively (χ=4.839, P=0.028). Cox multivariate analysis showed that chemotherapy regimen and number of metastatic organs were independent factors for OS. The effect of the radiotherapy dose on the primary tumor on OS was close to statistically significant. The incidence of grade 3-4 neutropenia was more significantly reduced in the DP group than in the PP group after matching (61.7 vs. 27.7%, P=0.002), with no between-group difference for adverse effects on platelets or hemoglobin. For patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma and unknown EGFR mutation status, PP was more effective than DP in prolonging survival and had a less adverse effect on neutrophils.',\n",

Understanding the mechanisms of resistance is critical to the care of these patients. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples were collected from 256 patients with T-treated MBC. Clinical information was collected retrospectively from the patients' medical records. Central review of HER2 status by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and/or immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed that of the 227 eligible patients only 139 (61%) were truly HER2-positive. PTEN, ER, PgR, and Ki67 were evaluated by IHC, while PTEN status was evaluated by FISH as well. PIK3CA mutations were identified with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping. Median time to progression (TTP) was 14.4\\xa0months for the HER2-positive and 10.3 for the HER2-negative patients (log-rank, P\\xa0=\\xa00.22). Survival from the initiation of T (survivalT) was 50.4\\xa0months for the HER2-positive and 35.3 for the HER2-negative subgroups (P\\xa0=\\xa00.006). Higher risk of progression was associated with HER2-positive status and the presence of PIK3CA mutations (P\\xa0=\\xa00.014). PTEN loss, as determined by IHC, was associated with lower survivalT in the whole population (P\\xa0=\\xa00.029) and in the HER2-positive population (P\\xa0=\\xa00.017). PIK3CA mutations and/or PTEN loss status were evaluated together as a single parameter, to estimate the impact of activation of the PI3K/AKT molecular pathway, and it was significantly associated with both decreased TTP (P\\xa0=\\xa00.003 in the total population, P\\xa0=\\xa00.004 in HER2-positive patients) and survival (survivalT, P\\xa0=\\xa00.011 in total, P\\xa0=\\xa00.006 in HER2-positive). In this trastuzumab-treated breast cancer population, PIK3CA activating mutations were associated with shorter TTP and PTEN loss with decreased survival. The activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway from either defect was associated with both TTP and survival, indicating the adverse effect of this pathway's status on trastuzumab efficacy.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'RATIONALE: Ramucirumab, a human Ig 1 monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, in combination with paclitaxel is a second-line chemotherapy for patients with metastatic gastric cancer. Several reports have suggested that dose adjustments of cetuximab, an anti- epidermal growth factor receptor antibody, are not required in patients with renal impairment. However, the combination chemotherapy of ramucirumab and cytotoxic drug for hemodialysis (HD) patients has not been reported. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 65-year-old man on HD was diagnosed with gastric cancer and underwent a subtotal gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) was examined after completion of 8 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine combination oxaliplatin. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed with advanced gastric cancer at stage IIIb (pT3N2M0) 11\\u200amonths ago. Unfortunately, 9\\u200amonths after the start of adjuvant chemotherapy, multiple liver metastases from gastric cancer were found by abdominal CT. INTERVENTIONS: He began receiving weekly paclitaxel(80\\u200amg/m2) and every 15-day ramucirumab (8\\u200amg/kg). HD was performed next day after administration of chemotherapy and repeated 3 times a week. OUTCOMES: He was treated with ramucirumab without dose adjustment. The metastatic liver mass had a partial response, after 2 and 4 cycles of chemotherapy and had a stable disease up to 12 cycles of chemotherapy. No obvious adverse effect was observed during treatment. However, after 14 cycles chemotherapy, follow-up abdominal CT revealed progression disease of multiple liver metastasis and lymph nodes invasion. LESSONS: The paclitaxel chemotherapy with ramucirumab is effective and safe in HD patients with metastatic gastric cancer. As seen in patients with normal kidney function, ramucirumab can be safely administered without a dose reduction.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Oral mucositis is a common adverse effect of cancer treatment that can increase the risk for local and systemic infection. This prospective study was designed to evaluate the preventive effects of an amino-acid-rich elemental diet (ED), Elental(®), on radiotherapy- or chemoradiotherapy-induced mucositis in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients. Fifty patients were enrolled in this prospective study, who had received radiation (60-70 Gy) with/without chemotherapy [S-1, UFT, cisplatin (CDDP), docetaxel (DOC) plus CDDP, or Cetuximab]. The Elental(®) group (25 patients) had received Elental(®) during treatment, and the control group (25 patients) had not. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors related to abatement of oral mucositis. A comparison of the rates of completion of chemoradiation treatments as well as the nutritional or inflammatory status between Elental(®) and control groups was performed. Multivariate analysis indicated that most of the patients who received Elental(®) suffered from a lower degree of mucositis and showed significantly improved rate of completion of chemoradiation (no interruption) compared to the control group. There was a significant difference between the Elental(®) group and the control group in terms of the mean change of C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in blood serum; however, there was no significant difference in terms of a mean change of body weight and total protein level in blood serum before and after chemoradiation. Our study shows that the Elental(®) elemental diet could be useful for the treatment of oral mucositis induced by chemoradiation. Elental(®) might also promote improved completion rates of chemoradiotherapy in OSCC patients.',\n",

Recognition and treatment of diverse adverse events related to T-DM1 is critical for safety and tolerability. The most frequent adverse events with T-DM1 include fatigue, diarrhea, anemia, elevated transaminases, and mild-to-moderate hemorrhagic events, which are thought to be related to induced thrombocytopenia. Here, we present five case series of cutaneous and mucosal telangiectasias, definitely related to T-DM1. The development of telangiectasias represents a newly recognized adverse effect of T-DM1. We provide description and timing of the telangiectasias and review the mechanisms that may explain the formation of these vascular lesions in association with T-DM1. Further, we describe associated bleeding events and propose that induced telangiectasias could represent an additional cause of T-DM1-associated hemorrhage.',\n",

The clinical outcomes of pembrolizumab in those patients is inconclusive. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a rarely reported immune-related adverse event in the field of immune checkpoint inhibitors therapy, raising challenges given the paucity of data with such presentations. We present the unique case of a 67-year-old female with advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC who successfully responded to pembrolizumab after EGFR-TKI resistance. However, the patient developed CRS after pembrolizumab initiation and presented with fever, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, tachycardia, and multiple organ dysfunction. Blood tests showed elevated levels of peripheral CD8+ T cells, C-reactive protein, and tumor necrosis factor-α. The symptoms rapidly improved after corticosteroid initiation. Based on the present case, we propose that pembrolizumab might be a potential salvage therapy for patients with advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC after EGFR-TKI resistance; CRS would be a sign of the antitumor effect of PD-1 inhibitors in those patients. However, CRS can be a fatal adverse effect and clinicians must remain vigilant for the rare toxicities to make prompt diagnosis and treatment.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab targets the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2). Cardiotoxicity is a potential adverse effect, manifesting as either an asymptomatic decline in left-ventricular ejection fraction or infrequently as largely reversible symptomatic heart failure (HF). Monitoring recommendations differ between product labeling and 2012 guidelines, and the clinical utility of serial cardiac monitoring in patients with metastatic breast cancer remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to describe the frequency of monitoring, incidence of symptomatic or asymptomatic HF, overall effect on treatment, and cost of monitoring for cardiotoxicity. METHODS: We preformed an institutional review board-approved retrospective chart review of breast cancer patients receiving trastuzumab from January 1, 2009, through January 1, 2014, at an academic medical center. RESULTS: Out of 154 treatments, 72% were adjuvant, and 28% were metastatic. In the adjuvant setting, a mean of 4.5 (interquartile range [IQR] = 4-5) echocardiograms (echos) over a mean of 11.5 (IQR = 11-12) months were performed. In the metastatic setting, a mean of 3.1 (IQR = 1-5) echos over a mean of 20.2 (IQR = 9-31) months were performed. Symptomatic HF events occurred in 4 adjuvant (3.6%) and 2 metastatic patients (6.5%); 10 patients (6.5%) had a treatment interruption, with 9 (90%) tolerating restart of trastuzumab. Two patients (1.3%) changed treatment as a result of cardiotoxicity. Using population incidence of HER2-positive breast cancer, $13 million could be saved if monitoring were reduced by 1 echo per patient. CONCLUSIONS: Given the low incidence of clinically significant HF and cost of monitoring, less frequent monitoring may be justified.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have improved outcomes in patients with various malignancies; however, they can cause immune-related hepatitis and enterocolitis. Patients on ICI may also develop upper gastrointestinal symptoms and undergo measurement of gastric emptying. AIMS: Our aim was to review records of patients with gastroparesis following ICI therapy at two medical centers. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all patients at Mayo Clinic and Brigham and Women's/Dana-Farber Cancer Center (BWH/DFCC) who underwent gastric scintigraphy for the assessment of symptoms of gastroparesis following ICI treatment up to January 2020. Clinical presentation, medical history, laboratory evaluation, imaging, treatment, and outcomes were retrieved from the records. Gastroparesis was diagnosed as delayed gastric emptying (GE) measured by gastric scintigraphy. RESULTS: At Mayo Clinic, 2 patients (median age 59\\xa0years, 1 male [M], 1 female [F]) had delayed GE, while 4 patients (median age 53\\xa0years, 3M, 1F) had normal GE following ICI use. Of those with delayed GE (diagnosed after 38 and 2\\xa0months of ICI initiation), 1 patient was treated for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and melanoma with ipilimumab; a second patient with breast cancer was treated with pembrolizumab. At BWH/DFCC, 2 patients (median age 56\\xa0years, 1M, 1F) had normal GE after ICI treatment, while a 62-year-old female with non-small cell lung cancer developed gastroparesis 3\\xa0months following initiation of nivolumab. CONCLUSION: This report documents gastroparesis as a potential adverse effect of ICI. Further studies should explore the potential for ICI therapy to damage anti-inflammatory macrophages that preserve the enteric neurons.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of bortezomib +/- docetaxel as second-line therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to bortezomib 1.5 mg/m2 (arm A) or bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 plus docetaxel 75 mg/m2 (arm B). A treatment cycle of 21 days comprised four bortezomib doses on days 1, 4, 8, and 11, plus, in arm B, docetaxel on day 1. Patients could receive unlimited cycles. The primary end point was response rate. RESULTS: A total of 155 patients were treated, 75 in arm A and 80 in arm B. Baseline characteristics were comparable. Investigator-assessed response rates were 8% in arm A and 9% in arm B. Disease control rates were 29% in arm A and 54% in arm B. Median time to progression was 1.5 months in arm A and 4.0 months in arm B. One-year survival was 39% and 33%, and median survival was 7.4 and 7.8 months in arms A and B, respectively. Adverse effect profiles were as expected in both arms, with no significant additivity. The most common grade > or = 3 adverse events were neutropenia, fatigue, and dyspnea (4% and 53%, 19% and 26%, and 17% and 14% of patients in arms A and B, respectively). CONCLUSION: Bortezomib has modest single-agent activity in patients with relapsed or refractory advanced NSCLC using this schedule, with minor enhancement in combination with docetaxel. Additional investigation of bortezomib in NSCLC is warranted in combination with other drugs known to be active, or using different schedules.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'The humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab has been in routine use for chemotherapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor II (HER2)-positive breast cancer. A major adverse effect of trastuzumab is cardiotoxicity. Well-established biomarkers or echocardiographic parameters to predict trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity have not yet been determined. We attempted to identify useful biomarkers and/or echocardiographic parameters to predict trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity. We prospectively investigated the cases of 19 women who received chemotherapy including anthracyclines and trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancer. We measured cardiac biomarkers and echocardiographic parameters before their chemotherapy and every 3\\xa0months up to 15\\xa0months until the end of the adjuvant trastuzumab therapy. We divided the patients into two groups: group R was the nine patients who showed a reduction of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥5%, and group N was the 10 patients who showed a reduction of LVEF <5%. The high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) level at 6\\xa0months was significantly higher in group R than in group N (11.0\\u2009±\\u20097.8\\xa0pg/mL vs. 4.0\\u2009±\\u20091.4\\xa0pg/mL, p\\u2009<\\u20090.01). The hs-TnT level with a cutoff value of 5.5\\xa0pg/mL at 6\\xa0months had 78% sensitivity and 80% specificity for predicting a reduction of LVEF at 15\\xa0months. In our evaluation of echocardiographic parameters at baseline, the diastolic function was more impaired in group R than in group N. The hs-TnT and echocardiographic parameters of diastolic function could be useful to predict trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Oral mucositis (OM) is a painful lesion that takes place in the mucosa of the oral cavity, usually its etiology is associated with drug therapies in cancer patients. It is presented as well-defined ulcers whose painful symptomatology sometimes implies the suspension of oncological treatment or parenteral feeding, being therefore an important adverse effect, marking the evolution of these types of therapies against cancer. The present work aim is to know the prevalence of oral mucositis in oral cancer immunotherapy compared to its prevalence in standard therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A protocol was developed for a systematic review following PRISMA® guidelines and a focused question (PICO) was constructed. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on electronic databases including PubMed, the SCOPUS database, the Cochrane library and the Web of Science (WOS). RESULTS: Six clinical trials were included that met the different inclusion criteria. In these articles, a discrepancy between the prevalence of OM in patients treated with chemotherapy and patients treated with immunotherapy related to the immune checkpoint PD-1/PD-L1 (Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of oral mucositis is lower in new immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies against oral cancer than drugs used so far (chemotherapy drugs [methotrexate, cisplatin] as well as cetuximab). However, more studies should be carried out to confirm these data.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"Monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutics have a promising outlook within the pharmaceutical industry having made positive strides in both research and development as well as commercialisation, however this development has been hampered by manufacturing failures and attrition. This study explores the applicability of traditional in vitro toxicity tests for detecting any off-target adverse effect elicited by mAbs on specific organ systems using hepatocarcinoma cell line (HepG2) and human dermal fibroblasts neonatal (HDFn), respectively. The mechanism of antibody dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) via complement activation, and complement dependent cellular cytotoxicity (CDCC) were assessed. Major results: no apparent ADCC, CDCC, or CDC mediated decrease in cell viability was measured for HepG2 cells. For HDFn cells, though ADCC or CDCC mediated decreases in cell viability wasn't detected, a CDC mediated decrease in cell viability was observed. Several considerations have been elucidated for development of in vitro assays better suited to detect off target toxicity of mAbs.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors, including anti-PD-1 therapies, have prolonged overall survival in patients with a variety of cancers, and immunotherapy is sometimes associated with immune-related adverse events (irAEs); however, hematological toxicity, especially neutropenia, is rare. CASE PRESENTATION: A 78-year-old man with squamous lung cancer, with brain metastasis, was treated with pembrolizumab and albumin-bound paclitaxel as first-line treatment for one cycle and changed to pembrolizumab plus anlotinib at the second cycle. After two therapy cycles, grade 4 neutropenia developed, which mainly contributed to irAEs. The patient was started on granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) but did not improve; he was then treated with corticosteroids, and neutrophil counts gradually returned to normal levels. However, the patient eventually died because of neurological problems. CONCLUSION: Grade 4 neutropenia associated with ICI, although rare, is often severe and presents with infectious complications; it needs to be diagnosed early, and clinicians should ensure prompt and proper management to such patients.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Gastric cancer is the fourth common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Due to lack of adequate information on the side effects of chemotherapy regimens in treatment of gastric cancer, this study was aimed to determine the side effects of two common chemotherapy regimens of gastric cancer. This prospective study was conducted in Emam Khomeini Educational Hospital and Touba Polyclinic; both are affiliated to Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences. The frequency and severity of side effects of chemotherapy were recorded based on the National Cancer Institution (NCI) Toxicity Criteria (version 2). DCF (Docetaxel, Cisplatin, 5FU) and FOLFOX (Folinic acid, 5FU, Oxaliplatin) adverse reactions were compared using SPSS 16 software. One hundred twenty five chemotherapy cycles administered to seventy four patients were assessed. The most common used regimens were DCF (70%) and FOLFOX (16%). The incidence of vomiting was higher with DCF compared to FOLFOX (P = 0.049). In more than 50% of cycles, DCF regimen caused diarrhea, while in FOLFOX regimen it was less than 9% (P = 0.002). Stomatitis, visual changes, nausea, skin reactions, and constipation were not significantly different between the two regimens. It seems that the adverse drug reactions of FOLFOX regimen were more favorable than DCF regimen. The results of this study may help clinicians choosing a more favorable chemotherapy regimen especially in patients with a low performance status who have difficulties in tolerating a chemotherapy regimen with a more severe adverse effect profile.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is an opportunistic infection that presents a ground-glass appearance in the lungs on chest radiography. Interstitial lung disease is a commonly reported adverse effect of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment; however, there are few reports of ICI treatment-associated PCP infection. A 77-year-old man with lung adenocarcinoma was administered pembrolizumab and hospitalized for dyspnea 2 weeks after treatment. Chest computed tomography showed bilateral ground-glass opacities in all lung lobes. PCP was therefore diagnosed, and steroids and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim were initiated. Following treatment, the patient's condition improved promptly. This report suggests that ICI treatment can cause PCP infection.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term efficacy and toxicity of definitive radiochemotherapy for solitary lymph node metastasis after curative surgery of esophageal cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We performed a retrospective review of 35 patients who underwent definitive radiochemotherapy at Tohoku University Hospital between 2000 and 2009 for solitary lymph node metastasis after curative esophagectomy with lymph node dissection for esophageal cancer. Radiotherapy doses ranged from 60 to 66 Gy (median, 60 Gy). Concurrent chemotherapy was platinum based in all patients. The endpoints of the present study were overall survival, cause-specific survival, progression-free survival, irradiated-field control, overall tumor response, and prognostic factors. RESULTS: The median observation period for survivors was 70.0 months. The 5-year overall survival was 39.2% (median survival, 39.0 months). The 5-year cause-specific survival, progression-free survival, and irradiated-field control were 43.3%, 31.0% and 59.9%, respectively. Metastatic lesion, size of the metastatic lymph node, and performance status before radiochemotherapy were significantly correlated with prognosis. Complete response and partial response were observed in 22.9% and 57.1% of the patients, respectively. There was no Grade 3 or higher adverse effect based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v3.0) in the late phase. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our study findings, approximately 40% of patients with solitary lymph node metastasis after curative resection for esophageal cancer have a chance of long-term survival with definitive radiochemotherapy.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy (TIPN) is a debilitating adverse effect of cancer treatments with taxanes which may require a reduction or discontinuation chemotherapy and affect clinical and survival outcomes. A number of factors have contributed to the increasing prevalence of TIPN. Nonetheless, limited knowledge exists of potential prechemotherapy blood-based biochemical factors associated with TIPN development. METHODS: We recruited breast cancer patients at seven cancer institutions in China. Participants aged 18 years or older with stage I to III breast cancer who scheduled to undergo primary neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy with taxanes were eligible. Eligible patients underwent patient-reported neuropathy assessments using the EORTC-CIPN20 questionnaire. Patients completed the questionnaire before commencing treatment and after every cycle. For every patient, we selected the highest TIPN toxicity score for analysis since the first cycle. The posttreatment TIPN severity was compared with blood-based biochemical factors within 30 days before commencing treatment. Independent samples t tests, Mann-Whitney U tests and linear regression were used to identify blood-based and clinical associations with TIPN development. RESULTS: The study included 873 breast cancer participants who received paclitaxel, docetaxel or nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab)-paclitaxel. In the whole cohort, factors associated with higher TIPN toxicity scores were higher cumulative chemotherapy dose (β\\xa0=\\xa00.005; 95% CI, 0.004 to 0.006; P\\xa0<\\xa0.001), lower sodium ions (β\\xa0=\\xa0-0.24; 95% CI, -0.39 to -0.09; P\\xa0=\\xa0.002) and higher chloride ions (β\\xa0=\\xa00.30; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.44; P\\xa0<\\xa0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that breast cancer patients with a higher cumulative chemotherapy dose, lower pretreatment sodium ions, and higher pretreatment chloride ions receiving taxanes should receive closer monitoring to mitigate the development of short-term and long-term TIPN.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"A 64-year-old patient developed a widespread autoimmune mucocutaneous blistering disease 3 weeks after the initiation of the anti-programmed death-1 (anti-PD-1) pembrolizumab therapy administered for a locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the buttocks arising from hidradenitis suppurativa. A diagnosis of paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP) was made based on the presence of a suprabasal acantholysis associated with intercellular deposits of immunoglobulin G and C3 on basement membrane zone. Analysis of the patient's sera was positive on monkey bladder and detected circulating antibodies against desmoglein 3 and desmoplakin I prior to the initiation of pembrolizumab. At that time, the patient had few localized blisters limited to the peri-tumoral skin of the buttocks with acantholysis but without in vivo immune deposits. Pembrolizumab therapy was discontinued and a complete remission of PNP was obtained using oral steroids. Reintroduction of pembrolizumab resulted in flare of PNP. Given the close temporal relation between pembrolizumab initiation and the subsequent clinical expression of a widespread PNP, the patient was diagnosed with pre-existing subclinical PNP exacerbated by PD-1 inhibitor. The extreme rarity of PNP in the setting of cutaneous SCC and the effects of challenge, dechallenge, and rechallenge of pembrolizumab argue in favor of a checkpoint inhibitor related adverse effect. Our case is the first PNP associated with anti-PD-1 therapy and serological follow-up suggest that one infusion of pembrolizumab is sufficient to allow clinical expression of underlying pemphigus auto-immunity.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVE: Hypophysitis is an increasingly recognized adverse effect of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy for malignancy. However, the mechanisms through which ICIs induce hypophysitis are largely unknown. We aim to describe 2 cases of ICI-mediated hypophysitis and perform autoantibody profiling on serial samples from these patients to determine if common autoantibodies could be identified. METHODS: We describe 2 cases of patients with metastatic urothelial cancer who received ICI therapy and subsequently developed severe fatigue, prompting a hormonal workup consistent with hypopituitarism. Patient 1 received the ICI ipilimumab (anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4) and patient 2 received the ICI pembrolizumab (anti-programmed cell death protein 1). Both patients had serial seromic immune biomarker profiling using high-density protein arrays before and after developing hypophysitis. Once a common autoantibody was found, zinc finger CCHC-type containing 8 (ZCCHC8), we used immunohistochemistry to assess its presence in pituitary tissue. RESULTS: Of a limited number of increased autoantibodies detected, those to ZCCHC8 were the only common antibodies to increase at least 3-fold post-hypophysitis in both patients. Using immunohistochemistry staining, we show for the first time that ZCCHC8 is expressed in pituitary gland tissue. CONCLUSION: Seromic profiling identified a common autoantibody, ZCCHC8, in 2 patients who developed hypophysitis on ICI therapy, and other serial autoantibody increases in each patient. These findings warrant validation in other cohorts to determine if the response is to self or tumor antigen, and may reveal novel insights into pituitary gland physiology and the pathogenesis of ICI-mediated hypophysitis.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'INTRODUCTION: While anticancer immunotherapies have traditionally focused on activation of the immune system, there is recent interest in disinhibition of the natural antitumor immune response by targeting immune checkpoints such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death-1 (PD-1). One humanized monoclonal antibody against PD-1, pembrolizumab, was recently approved for treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma. METHODS: We report exacerbation of myasthenia gravis (MG) after treatment with pembrolizumab and provide a brief literature review. RESULTS: We describe a 75-year-old man with stable MG who experienced myasthenic crisis in the setting of pembrolizumab treatment. A concurrent azathioprine taper was a possible although unlikely contributor given the short time interval between taper and exacerbation. CONCLUSIONS: As long-term data become available regarding the adverse immune effects of novel checkpoint inhibitors, clinicians should be mindful of their risks/benefits and of possible autoimmune disease exacerbation.

       "  'AB': 'The stabilization of spindle fibersis important for successful vitrification of bovine oocytes because microtubules and other cytoskeleton fibers (CSF) can be damaged during vitrification, resulting in failure of fertilization after thawing. Docetaxel, a stabilizing agent, could potentially reduce CSF damage of bovine oocytes induced during vitrification. However, there have been no reports on the effects of docetaxel on their vitrification. Experiment 1 was conducted to investigate the effects of various doses of docetaxel (0.0, 0.05, 0.5, 5.0 and 50 μM) in preincubation medium of in vitro matured (IVM) bovine oocytes on their developmental ability after in vitro fertilization (IVF). The results show that 0.05 μM docetaxel had no adverse effect on embryo development, while docetaxel at a concentration of ⩾0.5 μM inhibited development. Experiments 2 and 3 were conducted to investigate the effects of preincubation of IVM bovine oocytes with 0.05 μM docetaxel for 30 min prior to vitrification-warming on CSF integrity (Experiment 2), and on oocyte survival and viability after IVF (Experiment 3). When preincubated with 0.05 μM docetaxel for 30 min before vitrification, post-thawed oocytes had less CSF damage and higher survival rates compared with those untreated with docetaxel before vitrification. Surviving oocytes also had higher rates of cleavage and development to the blastocyst stage after IVF. In conclusion, preincubation of IVM bovine oocytes with 0.05 μM docetaxel for 30 min before vitrification was effective at preventing CSF damage during vitrification, and improving oocyte viability after warming and subsequent cleavage and blastocyst formation after IVF.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Programmed cell death 1 inhibitors have revolutionized therapy for cancer by their outstanding effectiveness. However, they may cause adverse effects, among which inflammatory myopathy is one of the most disabling. To elucidate its mechanism, we analysed muscle biopsies and compared them with other inflammatory myopathies. METHODS: Muscle biopsies from three patients with inflammatory myopathy after treatment with PD-1 inhibitors for cancer were subjected to immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analyses to localize CD8+ cytotoxic cells and markers of lymphoid follicles. For comparison, two cases of polymyositis and one of juvenile dermatomyositis were examined. RESULTS: Nearly identical pathological features were observed in the three cases. In the island-like foci of inflammation, muscle fibers were undergoing degeneration. CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, macrophages, CD4+ cells, and B cells were observed in the foci. CD8+ cells were seen outside and inside the basal lamina of non-necrotic muscle fibers. Lymphoid follicle-like structures with CD21+ follicular dendritic cells were present. The blood vessels in the foci showed features consistent with the high endothelial venules, on which their markers, PNAd and CCL21, were expressed. In polymyositis, blood vessels stained only faintly for PNAd and CCL21, while in juvenile dermatomyositis, in which tertiary lymphoid follicle-like structure was reported in the past, they stained positively. CONCLUSIONS: In inflammatory myopathy associated with PD-1 inhibitors, CD8+ cells appear to predominantly destruct muscle fibers. The presence of lymphoid follicle-like structures and expression of PNAd and CCL21 on the endothelial cells suggest the tertiary lymphoid organs are formed, and involved in the leakage of lymphocytes. Thus, in the three cases examined, formation of the tertiary lymphoid organs is likely to play an important role in genesis of the PD-1 myopathy.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'PLGA-based nanomedicines have enormous potential for targeted cancer therapy. To boost their stability, targetability, and intracellular drug release, here we developed novel multifunctional PLGA anticancer nanomedicines by combining a reductively cleavable surfactant (RCS), vitamin E-SS-oligo(methyl diglycol l-glutamate), with covalent hyaluronic acid (HA) coating. Reduction-sensitive HA-coated PLGA nanoparticles (rHPNPs) were obtained with small sizes of 55-61 nm and ζ potentials of -26.7 to -28.8 mV at 18.4-40.3 wt % RSC. rHPNPs were stable against dilution and 10% FBS while destabilized under reductive condition. The release studies revealed significantly accelerated docetaxel (DTX) release in the presence of 10 mM glutathione. DTX-rHPNPs exhibited potent and specific antitumor effect to CD44 + A549 lung cancer cells (IC(50) = 0.52 μg DTX equiv/mL). The in vivo studies demonstrated that DTX-rHPNPs had an extended circulation time and greatly enhanced tolerance in mice. Strikingly, DTX-rHPNPs completely inhibited growth of orthotopic human A549-Luc lung tumor in mice, leading to a significantly improved survival rate and reduced adverse effect as compared to free DTX. This study highlights that advanced nanomedicines can be rationally designed by combining functional surfactants and surface coating.',\n",

Herein, we report the case of a patient with Lynch syndrome-associated, locally advanced mismatch repair protein deficiency pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas who demonstrated a sustained response to second-line treatment with pembrolizumab, but eventually developed immune-related diabetic ketoacidosis requiring discontinuation of treatment. He has since remained in remission, off treatment, over the following 3\\xa0years, with regular surveillance showing no clinical or radiographic evidence of disease progression.

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapy has shown a favorable efficacy in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Conversely, K-RAS mutations were reported to have an adverse effect on the survival of patients with NSCLC. These studies suggest that the tumor biology of patients with EGFR or K-RAS mutations is different from that of patients with wild-type mutations. Therefore, we hypothesized that the response to cytotoxic chemotherapy may differ among patients with and without EGFR or K-RAS mutations. METHODS: A total of 229 patients with advanced NSCLC who received platinum doublet chemotherapy were included in this retrospective study, and their clinical outcomes were analyzed according to EGFR and K-RAS mutation status. RESULTS: EGFR and K-RAS mutations were found in 52.4% and 27.9% of patients, respectively. Progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly higher in patients with EGFR mutations than in patients with wild-type EGFR (P = .008), and multivariate analysis showed that EGFR mutation was an independent factor to chemotherapy (P = .01). Among the patients with EGFR mutations, the disease control rate for docetaxel was higher than for gemcitabine-based therapy (P = .031). In addition, docetaxel or vinorelbine showed a longer PFS than gemcitabine-based chemotherapy in patients with EGFR mutations (P = .033 and P = .028). However, no similar differences were found according to the K-RAS mutations. CONCLUSIONS: EGFR, but not K-RAS mutation, is associated with improved survival time to platinum-based chemotherapy. In patients with EGFR mutations, PFS for docetaxel and gemcitabine was higher than for vinorelbine-based chemotherapies. The predictive meaning of EGFR mutation for chemotherapy should be further investigated.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA) is a distressing adverse effect of many chemotherapy agents. The TC (docetaxel [Taxotere] and cyclophosphamide) chemotherapy regimen is typically associated with complete alopecia. Scalp cooling with cold caps has been reported to minimize or prevent CIA. We conducted a prospective study to assess efficacy of scalp cooling in preventing CIA among women receiving adjuvant TC chemotherapy for breast cancer. METHODS: Women at the Weill Cornell Breast Center who independently elected to use scalp cooling with cold caps during adjuvant TC chemotherapy were asked to participate. Degree of hair loss was assessed by a single practitioner using Dean's alopecia scale (grade 1/excellent [< 25% hair loss], grade 2/good [25%-50% hair loss], grade 3/moderate [50%-75% hair loss], grade 4/poor [> 75% hair loss]), by digital photographs, and by patient self-report of hair thinning or the need to wear a wig/head covering, or both. Assessments were made before each chemotherapy treatment and at follow-up visits between 3 weeks and 3 months after completion of chemotherapy. RESULTS: Of 20 evaluable patients, 10% reported a need to wear a wig/head covering at the follow-up visit. Dean's alopecia score was excellent for 65% of patients, good for 25% of patients, and moderate or poor for 10% of patients. The majority of patients reported hair thinning after every chemotherapy cycle. No patient discontinued therapy because of an intolerance to cold caps. CONCLUSION: Scalp cooling with cold caps appears to be effective in preventing CIA among the majority of women undergoing treatment with TC chemotherapy.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Cardiotoxicity is an adverse effect of trastuzumab (TRA) in the treatment of human epidermal growth factor 2 positive (HER2+) breast cancer. Current literature on the cardioprotective effects of agents targeted against the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and beta-blockers (BB) in TRA-treated HER2+ breast cancer patients is conflicting. We hypothesized that concurrent use of RAAS inhibitors would prevent TRA-induced cardiotoxicity (TIC). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Surveillance ejection fraction (EF) at 3-month intervals up to 36\\u2009months obtained from echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scans were retrospectively compared to baseline EF in TRA-treated HER2+ breast cancer patients between 2011 to 2016 at a tertiary cancer center. TIC was defined as a decrease of EF by more than 15 EF percentage points from baseline on surveillance imaging. Cardiac medications and comorbidities were compared between patients with reduced EF secondary to TIC (rEF) and patients who did not experience TIC (pEF). A published clinical risk score (CRS) was applied to the patient population with calculated sensitivity analyses to determine if the CRS could predict TIC. RESULTS: Of 127 patients with TRA-treated HER2+ breast cancer, 11% developed cardiotoxicity resulting in discontinuation of TRA. Cardiotoxicity with reduced EF was seen as early as 3\\u2009months and at subsequent 3-month follow up intervals up to the 15-month follow-up. Co-existing arrhythmia, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN) and diabetes mellitus (DM) tended to infer an increased risk for cardiotoxicity. Patients with pEF were found to be concurrently on a RAAS inhibitor more than the rEF group (OR of 0.24, 95% CI 0.05-1.11, p 0.06). The CRS high-risk cut-off had a sensitivity of 0.17 (95% CI 0.03-0.49), specificity of 0.89 (95% CI 0.82-0.94), positive predictive value of 0.14 (95% CI 0.03-0.44) and negative predictive value of 0.91 (95% CI 0.84-0.95). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the concurrent use of a RAAS inhibitors during TRA treatment may provide a protective effect against TIC and warrants further investigation. The low sensitivity and positive predictive value demonstrated that the CRS has minimal utility as a screening tool for prediction of patients at high risk for TIC. Therefore, closer surveillance of patients receiving TRA is warranted for early detection of TIC.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'IMPORTANCE: Inhibition of angiogenesis is an effective anticancer strategy because neoplasms require a rich blood supply. Ramucirumab, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2014 to treat gastric adenocarcinomas and non-small cell lung carcinomas, targets vascular endothelial growth factor 2 (VEGFR2). We identified a patient prescribed a regimen of irinotecan hydrochloride, cetuximab, and ramucirumab for metastatic rectal cancer (diagnosed in November 2013 and treated through early January 2015) who developed a new-onset, expanding vascular lesion on his right leg. Via exome sequencing, we found that the lesion contained a single somatic mutation in KDR (encodes VEGFR2), possibly in response to ramucirumab. Vascular tumors are not a known complication of antiangiogenic therapeutics. OBSERVATIONS: Exome sequencing of the well-demarcated, blanching vascular lesion on the lateral right shin revealed a somatic p.T771R mutation in KDR, without evidence of other somatic mutations or loss of heterozygosity. Histological features included lobules of small vessels within the dermis, resembling a tufted angioma. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A potential adverse effect of ramucirumab in combination therapy is the development of sporadic angiomas. The p.T771R mutation was previously implicated in autophosphorylation of VEGFR2 and reported in angiosarcomas alongside other driver mutations. Our observations suggest that this mutation confers a proliferative advantage in the setting of ramucirumab therapy. Patients receiving ramucirumab should be monitored for the development of new vascular lesions.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Cardiotoxicity is a well-known adverse effect of various chemotherapeutic agents that can be monitored by echocardiography. A decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) triggers consideration for therapy modification or interruption. The aim of this study was to evaluate how variability in LVEF estimates computed using three-dimensional echocardiography could influence cardiotoxicity onset detection. METHODS: One hundred eighty one patients with breast cancer treated with anthracycline and trastuzumab were analyzed. LVEF was computed using two commercial software packages. In a subgroup of 40 patients, three-dimensional echocardiographic data were reanalyzed to assess intra- and interobserver variability by two expert investigators using both packages. Global longitudinal strain (GLS) imaging was evaluated in 64 patients. RESULTS: End-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, and LVEF measurements obtained applying the two software packages were in good agreement, with small bias and acceptable limits of agreement. Intra- and interobserver variability was smaller using one of the two software packages. However, for both packages, variability indexes were in the range of affecting LVEF estimates at a level that could lead to an inaccurate assessment of cardiac adverse effects of cancer therapeutic drugs. On the basis of LVEF, 11 of 181 patients (6.1%) had cardiotoxicity at 3-month follow-up. The absolute value of GLS was smaller in 16 of 64 patients (25%) thought to have cardiotoxicity on the basis of GLS results, including six of seven patients who had cardiotoxicity considering LVEF in this subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: Following clinical definition of cardiotoxicity onset, variability in LVEF computation by three-dimensional echocardiography could be a confounding factor for cardiotoxicity diagnosis, and different software packages should not be used interchangeably for LVEF monitoring. GLS confirms its predictive value for subsequent cardiotoxicity.',\n",

       "  'AB': '(Neo)adjuvant chemotherapy for early stage breast cancer is associated with side-effects, resulting in increased emergency department (ED) presentations. Treatment-related toxicity can affect quality of life, compromise chemotherapy delivery and treatment outcomes, and increase healthcare use. We performed a retrospective study of ED presentations in patients receiving curative chemotherapy for early breast cancer to identify factors contributing to ED presentations. Of 102 patients, 39 (38%) presented to ED within 30 days of chemotherapy, resulting in 63 ED presentations in total. Most common reasons were non-neutropenic fever (17 presentations/27%), neutropenic fever (15/24%), pain (9/14%), drug reaction (6/10%) and infection (4/6%). Factors significantly associated with ED presentation were adjuvant chemotherapy timing compared to neoadjuvant timing (P = 0.031), prophylactic antibiotics (P = 0.045) and docetaxel-containing regimen (P = 0.018).',\n",

On the 32nd day after the fourth course of chemotherapy, the patient developed bloody sputum. She was found dead at home on the 34th day. Autopsy revealed a diffuse alveolar hemorrhage without diffuse alveolar damage. Endothelial cells of the small arteries and capillaries were swollen and desquamated, indicating that alveolar capillaries were injured. The similar pathological changes in blood vessels were also observed in the kidney and the digestive tract. Because diffuse alveolar hemorrhage caused by cisplatin and docetaxel has never been reported apart from interstitial pneumonitis, bevacizumab is the most suspicious drug for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in our case. Chest physicians and oncologists should be aware that although it is very rare, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage can develop during any course of chemotherapy with bevacizumab.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'The emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in recent years has transformed the landscape of the management of solid tumors. The advancement of immunotherapy has resulted in a brand new set of adverse outcomes not previously seen in classical chemotherapy. One such adverse effect has been termed as hyperprogressive disease (HPD), a phenomenon characterized by rapid tumor progression, which often leads to devastating outcomes. In this report, we present a unique case of a 48-year-old African American female who\\xa0initially presented with abdominal pain, fatigue, and weight loss. Subsequent CT scan showed extensive irregular wall and luminal narrowing with an eccentric mass and adenopathy along the portacaval space. Tumor markers were found to be elevated and genetic testing was done. The patient was diagnosed with stage IIIC colon cancer with K-RAS wild type, associated with Lynch syndrome. The patient underwent surgical resection, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy for progressive/stage IV disease. In light of the progression of the disease, pembrolizumab was introduced into the treatment regimen. One month after the treatment, a repeat CT scan showed enlargement of the metastatic lesion with almost double the size. The progression of the disease was so rapid and, ultimately, pembrolizumab administration was withheld and the patient passed away after about two months on pembrolizumab. To our knowledge, this is one of the few cases of HPD reported in patients with advanced colon cancer, particularly in one\\xa0with Lynch syndrome. Further studies are warranted to understand why some individuals benefit from immunotherapy, whereas others experience grave outcomes.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'OBJECTIVE: To report an unusual reaction associated with weekly administration of paclitaxel. CASE SUMMARIES: Onycholysis was seen in four women with recurrent ovarian cancer being treated with low-dose, weekly paclitaxel. Two of the patients had previously received higher doses of paclitaxel on an every-three-week schedule without similar reactions. Onycholysis developed between weeks 10-13 of treatment in three of the patients. In the fourth patient, it developed shortly after initiation of weekly paclitaxel. None of the reactions required dose adjustments or discontinuation of therapy. Direct toxicity to the nail bed or inhibition of angiogenesis are possible mechanisms for this reaction. DISCUSSION: Onycholysis, separation of the nail from the nail bed, is an infrequent adverse effect of drug therapy. Antineoplastic drugs have previously been reported to cause onycholysis, pigmentation, bands, thickening or thinning of the nail bed, and nail shedding. Nail changes with the taxanes, primarily docetaxel, are reported in up to 30-40% of patients. Paclitaxel is not commonly associated with dermatologic reactions, although localized skin reactions and tissue necrosis have been reported. Nail changes, pigmentation or discoloration of the nail bed, occur in 2% of patients receiving paclitaxel. CONCLUSIONS: Onycholysis is an uncommon reaction that may occur in some patients receiving weekly, low-dose paclitaxel therapy. The reaction is not life-threatening and does not warrant discontinuation of therapy. However, clinicians should be aware of the possibility of this effect and be prepared to advise patients who develop signs of nail changes.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is a malignant smooth muscle neoplasm, in which the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is very limited. What is worse, loss of PTEN, known as a negative factor for ICB, frequently occurred in LMS. Seeking new strategies for LMS patients harboring loss of PTEN is important and challenging. CASE PRESENTATION: A 42-year-old Chinese male was diagnosed as having unresectable LMS of the iliopsoas. After the failure of two prior chemotherapy regimens, whole-exome sequencing revealed that tumor tissue had high tumor mutation burden (689 Muts), high microsatellite instability, and some somatic mutations, including PTEN (copy number loss and p.N323fs), MSH6 (p.F1088fs), TP53 p.R273C, ASXL1 p.G645fs, ATR p.S1843P, and CDKN2A p.A118P. Then, antiangiogenic agent (pazopanib or anlotinib) plus pembrolizumab was administered from January 2 to August 6, 2018. However, pazopanib was stopped on June 18 due to the grade 2/3 adverse effect of hand-foot skin reaction, and anlotinib was administered. Considering that the tumor shrunk after immunotherapy, he underwent radical resection on September 6, 2018. The final pathological diagnosis confirmed pathologic complete response (CR). Until the latest follow-up (September 15, 2021), no progressive disease was observed and total disease-free survival has exceeded 36 months. CONCLUSION: We presented a patient with an unresectable mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient LMS harboring biallelic loss of PTEN who achieved CR from a combination strategy of antiangiogenesis plus pembrolizumab. Such a strategy might be a promising strategy to overcome the ICB resistance caused by the loss of PTEN. Such conclusions need to be further confirmed in further investigations.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: The anti-Programmed Death receptor 1 (anti-PD-1) antibodies nivolumab and pembrolizumab are new treatments in metastatic melanoma. Immunotherapies are best known to be responsible for thrombotic microangiopathy. However, immune interstitial nephritis has been described in a patient treated by nivolumab and ipilimumab concomitantly, and three cases of granulomatous interstitial nephritis have been reported with ipilimumab monotherapy. We report herein a case of acute interstitial immune nephritis in a patient treated with nivolumab after ipilimumab for pulmonary metastatic melanoma. CASE PRESENTATION: Interstitial nephritis was diagnosed after acute kidney injury following three cycles and was confirmed by kidney biopsy. Kidney injury responded rapidly to prednisolone, which was then gradually reduced. As a follow-up computed tomography scan indicated mixed response, with minimal size progression of a pulmonary nodule, but a significant reduction in the size of the other nodules, nivolumab was reintroduced after renal function improvement. Low-dose corticosteroids were first maintained during nivolumab treatment and subsequently discontinued. Only one month after prednisolone discontinuation, creatinine levels increased. A second kidney biopsy confirmed relapse of acute interstitial nephritis. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first case of nivolumab-induced acute interstitial immune nephritis. This case highlights that anti-PD-1 immunotherapy may be continued when renal function is adequate, and this requires close interaction between dermatologists and nephrologists. This adverse effect should be made known to prescribers as nivolumab is associated with significant improvement of survival in metastatic melanoma and may be used in many different types of cancer.',\n",

As a result, the exacerbation of TB is now considered a severe adverse effect of nivolumab and pembrolizumab.

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Multiple new targeted agents have been developed for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) - positive breast cancer. Patients with HER2- positive breast cancer will develop brain metastases with greater incidence than patients with non-HER2 cancers, and many of them will undergo stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or other CNS radiotherapy. The interaction between radiation effects and new targeted agents is not well understood. We report two cases suggesting a novel adverse effect of T-DM1 (trastuzumab emtansine) on symptomatic enlargement of radiation necrosis (RN) after SRS. CASE PRESENTATION: Two patients with HER2-positive breast cancer had received SRS for single brain metastasis more than 5-years ago. They had been heavily treated for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (trastuzumab and pacritaxel, lapatinib and capecitabine). They initiated T-DM1 therapy for progressive systematic disease 5.5\\xa0years after stereotactic irradiation, when a small RN was recognized on brain MR images of each patient. The RN lesions increased in size and became symptomatic during 13 or 14\\xa0months of T-DM1 treatment. The patients underwent surgical resection of the lesion. Pathological examination revealed necrosis, hematoma, granulation tissue and telangiectasia without neoplastic cells. CONCLUSIONS: A potential enhancement of RN by T-DM1 in the brain may be one of important adverse events associated with the use of T-DM1 for patients after SRS. These cases highlight the need of careful follow-up when combining new systemic targeted therapies and SRS for brain metastases.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'We present the case of a 73-year-old male patient with a history of tobacco use who presented with a central nervous system mass that was confirmed to be a lung adenocarcinoma metastasis. High PD-L1 expression as well as negativity to other targetable drivers led to initiation of pembrolizumab monotherapy and ablative stereotactic radiation therapy on oligo-residual disease, achieving a complete response after 2 years of therapy. Following discontinuation of systemic treatment, the patient developed widespread desquamative plaques. A skin biopsy revealed subepidermal blistering and eosinophilic infiltration in conjunction with C3 and IgG depositions on the basement membrane, detected by immunofluorescence. A diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid was obtained, and systemic corticosteroids were administered with lesion progression. Infliximab was also administered without meaningful clinical improvement. Metronomic cyclophosphamide achieved a complete resolution of skin lesions and up to this day the patient continues with tumor control and is free of dermatological findings. In conclusion, bullous pemphigoid is a very rare dermatological adverse effect related with pembrolizumab treatment. Only two cases, including this one, have been reported, especially with this medication for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. With more reported cases, management strategies can be optimized even in the steroid refractory setting.',\n",

Although several cases of encephalitis have been reported as immune-related adverse effects of ICIs, epilepsy has not been reported following ICI treatment. We describe the case of an elderly woman with bladder carcinoma who experienced two episodes of generalized seizures after treatment with pembrolizumab. The episodes were atypical of encephalitis, because the seizures were completely responsive to AEDs and the CSF parameters normalized completely without immunotherapy. Since interictal EEG revealed persistent epileptic discharges after the seizures, pembrolizumab was considered to have induced a chronic state of epileptogenicity as the possible pathology, with a clinical picture similar to that of autoimmune epilepsy. The possibility that ICIs may cause an immune-related adverse effect, such as a chronic epileptic condition, should be considered, since ICIs are used widely.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"The programmed death 1 (PD-1), programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) immune checkpoints are negative regulators of T-cell immune function. Inhibition of these targets by antibodies (PD-1 blocking therapy) has been explored to treat solid malignancies such as melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer and other cancers. PD-1 blocking therapy is known to cause gastrointestinal tract adverse events in some patients and some of the adverse events are thought to be immune-mediated. Cancer patients receiving PD-1 blocking therapy have often failed several lines of chemotherapy and thus potentially are susceptible to a variety of infections including cytomegaloviral infection. However, there has not been any report of concurrent immune-mediated gastroenterocolitis and cytomegaloviral infection in cancer patients receiving PD-1 blocking therapy. Herein, we report one unusual case of histologically confirmed gastritis with features of immune-mediated pangastritis and cytomegaloviral infection in one patient who had metastatic urothelial carcinoma and received PD-1 blocking therapy, initially with atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1 antibody) followed by a switch to pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) because of tumor progression. Pembrolizumab was held and intravenous ganciclovir treatment was started, the patient's symptoms (abdominal pain and vomiting) were significantly improved and she was discharged from the hospital in stable conditions on hospital day 5. Pathologists should be aware of PD-1 blocking therapy-associated immune-mediated gastrointestinal tract adverse effect and concurrent cytomegaloviral infection.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'Docetaxel is a new taxoid widely used in chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer and other solid malignancies. Painful nail changes with onycholysis occur in about 40% of docetaxel-treated patients as a prominent adverse effect. We report a patient with a complete peripheral palsy of the right arm due to advanced breast cancer with diffuse tumor infiltration of the brachial plexus. Treatment with docetaxel led to onycholysis at all extremities except the paretic hand. Sensory and motoric innervation measured by nerve conduction studies showed a complete loss of large nerve fiber function of the right arm. Function of deep mechanosensitive A beta-fibers (quantitative vibrametry) was severely decreased, but not absent. Sympathetic reflexes (induced by deep inspiration and measured with laser Doppler flowmetry) were absent on the right side and skin temperature was decreased consistent with a complete sympathetic denervation. Small afferent fibers investigated by quantitative thermotesting revealed a total loss of thermal and pain sensation. Furthermore, iontophoresis of histamine failed to induce any axon reflex-vasodilatation indicating a complete peripheral degeneration of small fiber afferents. In summary, a severe denervation of small and large fibers of the right upper limb was revealed. These results indicate that integrity of peripheral nerves seems to be a substantial factor for docetaxel-mediated nail changes. The role of an inflammatory process in onycholysis maintained by postganglionic sympathetic terminals and nociceptive C-fiber afferents is discussed. In accordance with this hypothesis, a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor improved nail alterations of the non-paretic limbs.',\n",

We report on a pregnant woman suffering from breast cancer who received a weekly neoadjuvant trastuzumab (Herceptin(®)) therapy from 15 weeks of gestation onward, in addition to a 3-weekly carboplatin/docetaxel chemotherapy. Fetal renal insufficiency with anhydramnios and missing visualization of the fetal bladder developed at 21 weeks. After discontinuation of trastuzumab and repeated instillation of amniotic fluid, the amount of amniotic fluid remained stable after 24 weeks of gestation. After caesarean section at 34 weeks because of fetal growth restriction, the renal function of the neonate was normal postnatally. In accordance with the current literature, our case shows a reversible adverse effect of trastuzumab on the fetal renal function and confirms the current recommendation that trastuzumab in pregnancy should be avoided. In pregnancies exposed to trastuzumab, treatment should be discontinued and the fetus should be closely monitored, with particular attention to the amniotic fluid and the fetal bladder volume, as these reflect fetal renal function.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"Checkpoint blockade immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of advanced melanoma, with impressive survival benefits attained through upregulation of the anticancer immune response. Blockade of regulatory checkpoint molecules can, however, also result in aberrant immune activation leading to undesirable inflammation and autoimmunity. Although many genetic determinants have been described in patients with primary autoimmune diseases, it is uncertain whether patients developing autoimmune skin disease as an adverse effect of anti-PD-1 therapy share the same genetic risks. Furthermore, it is also unclear whether treatment with these agents can result in the unveiling of underlying 'silent' autoimmunity resulting in chronic inflammatory disease. We report three cases of cutaneous lupus associated with pembrolizumab therapy for advanced melanoma. One patient had a previous diagnosis of histologically proven discoid lupus erythematosus, well-controlled without treatment for over 2 years, which flared on first exposure to pembrolizumab. The remaining two patients had no previous history of autoimmune disease; both developed cutaneous eruptions, histologically and immunohistologically, in keeping with subacute cutaneous lupus following treatment with pembrolizumab. Our report bolsters what is currently an exceedingly small body of evidence documenting the development of cutaneous lupus in the setting of pembrolizumab therapy. Our third case specifically documents an otherwise unreported severe reflare of previously diagnosed, quiescent discoid lupus erythematosus in the setting of pembrolizumab, vividly highlighting the potential for autoimmune and specifically, lupus reactivation in the setting of anti-PD-1 therapy.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: We conducted a pilot phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of docetaxel and cisplatin as a combination second-line therapy for advanced gastric cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2000 and 2003, 30 patients were enrolled into this study. Chemotherapy consisted of 60 mg/m2 of docetaxel followed by 60 mg/m2 of cisplatin. This regimen was repeated at least three times at 3-week intervals. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 26.7%. The median time to disease progression was 4.5 months. The median survival time was 13 months from the start of the first-line therapy and 6 months from the second-line therapy. With respect to toxicity, the major adverse effect was leukopenia, which reached grades 3-4 in 26.7%. Non-hematological toxicities were usually moderate, and no deaths were attributable to the adverse effects of the drugs. CONCLUSION: This combination therapy was effective as a second-line treatment for advanced gastric cancer with acceptable toxic side-effects.',\n",

We report seven breast cancer patients who developed docetaxel-induced diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD) of an organizing pneumonia pattern on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). The patients presented with progressive breathlessness within four weeks of the final dose. All had an organizing pneumonia pattern on their HRCTs, without other evidence of infection. Restrictive lung disease with low carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) was noted, with desaturation on a 6-min walk test (6MWT). They were started on prednisolone. Repeated HRCT after four to eight weeks from the commencement of steroid treatment showed marked improvement. The clinical and functional improvement were also significant. One patient succumbed to the illness as a result of severe lung involvement. Docetaxel-induced DPLD is a fatal adverse effect, which can be managed by the cessation of the drug and starting on steroids in adequate doses.',\n",

Herein, we report the case of a 59-year-old woman on pembrolizumab for advanced NSCLC which developed a severe and persistent colitis treated with infliximab for several months following anti-PD-1 antibody discontinuation.

       "  'AB': 'INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Mechanical small bowel obstruction (SBO) is amongst the commonest diagnoses encountered in surgical departments. Although the aetiology is frequently post-surgical adhesions, the condition can arise in a virgin abdomen and we now know several of these cases do not require acute operative management. Here we report one such case where a small bowel obstruction transpired due to enteritis in the setting of chemoimmunotherapy with no prior abdominal surgery. CASE PRESENTATION: A 62 year old male presented to our department with 2 days of vomiting and obstipation. This is on a background of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer for which he was due for his 4(th) cycle of carboplatin, pemetrexed and pembrolizumab. Computed Tomography (CT) of the abdomen demonstrated a segment of thickened distal small bowel without any mass lesion, along with upstream dilatation. The findings were consistent with a mechanical SBO due to enteritis. Infective causes were excluded. The patient successfully recovered with non-operative intervention in the coming days. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Enteritis is an established adverse effect of various chemoimmunotherapy agents, though a case severe enough to produce a mechanical bowel obstruction is exceptionally rare. We demonstrate through this case that the condition may resolve through conservative measures. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of chemoimmunotherapy-related enteritis producing an SBO although uncommon, should be considered in the relevant population. A non-operative approach may be appropriate under some circumstances.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Oral cancer is the fourth-most common cause of death in males and overall the sixth-most common cause of cancer death in Taiwan. Surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy combined with other therapies are the most common treatments for oral cavity cancer. Although cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil and docetaxel are commonly used clinically, there is no drug specific for oral cavity cancer. Here, we demonstrated that derivatives of 3a-aza-cyclopenta[a]indene, a class of newly synthesized alkylating agents, may be drugs more specific for oral cancer based on its potent in vitro cytotoxicity to oral cancer cells and on in vivo xenografts. Among them, BO-1090, bis(hydroxymethyl)-3a-aza-cyclopenta[a]indene derivative, targeted DNA for its cytotoxic effects as shown by inhibition of DNA synthesis (bromodeoxyuridine-based DNA synthesis assay), induction of DNA crosslinking (alkaline gel shift assay), and induction of DNA single-stranded breaks (Comet assay) and double-stranded breaks (γ-H2AX focus formation). Following DNA damage, BO-1090 induced G1/S-phase arrest and apoptosis in oral cancer cell lines. The therapeutic potential of BO-1090 was tested in mice that received a xenograft of oral cavity cancer cell lines (SAS or Cal 27 cells). Intravenous injection of BO-1090 significantly suppressed tumor growth in comparison to control mice. BO-1090 also significantly reduced the tumor burden in orthotopic mouse models using SAS cells. There was no significant adverse effect of BO-1090 treatment with this dosage based on whole blood count, biochemical enzyme profiles in plasma and histopathology of various organs in mouse. Taken together, our current results demonstrate that B0-1090 may have potential as a treatment for oral cavity cancer.',\n",

PURPOSE: The aim of this clinical pilot study was to evaluate the toxicity and efficacy of LDM chemotherapy with weekly low-dose docetaxel for previously treated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The enrolled patients received 15 mg/m(2) of docetaxel intravenously on a weekly basis without any interval. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients were enrolled in the study; 20 were men, and seven were women. The median age was 62 years (range: 32-75). Eleven patients were stage IIIB, and 16 were stage IV. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 0 or 1. There was no severe hematological adverse effect; importantly, there was no neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. The objective response rate was 7.4% and the disease control rate was 51.9%. The median survival time was 16.4 months (95% CI: 5.7-36.4). CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results indicate that our metronomic regimen was well tolerated and active in patients with previously treated NSCLC. Thus, further investigation of this LDM regimen is warranted.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'IMPORTANCE: Curative treatment of aggressive Kaposi sarcoma (KS) with conventional chemotherapy in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients remains difficult. The administration of thalidomide, an immunomodulatory drug with antiangiogenic effects, is limited by its toxicity. This engenders interest in evaluating thalidomide analogues such as lenalidomide with better toxicity profiles. To our knowledge, we describe for the first time a patient with visceral KS successfully treated with lenalidomide. OBSERVATIONS: A man with advanced visceral HIV-related KS progressing after 11 months of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and 2 lines of conventional chemotherapy (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and docetaxel) was treated with lenalidomide on a compassionate use basis. He showed a rapid partial response without any substantial adverse effect but experienced relapse after 5 months of treatment, in a context of virologic failure. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Similar to our observation, good partial response without toxic effects has been reported in 3 patients with only skin involvement. Because immune reconstitution syndrome may occur in HIV-infected patients with KS undergoing HAART, KS improvement may be partly explained by immune recovery. An ongoing US phase 1/2 trial will better evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of lenalidomide in patients with HIV-related KS with and without visceral involvement.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'The purpose was to determine the optimal multifractionated (MF) dosing schedule to permit the delivery of four active agents in nonsmall cell lung cancer simultaneously in alternating doublets (docetaxel-cisplatin alternating with gemcitabine-vinorelbine). Three MF schedules were used: schedule A weekly; schedule B twice weekly for 2 weeks repeated every 21 days; and schedule C twice weekly every other week. Dose fractions were fixed for each component drug: docetaxel 50 mg/m2 plus cisplatin 20 mg/m2 and gemcitabine 500 mg/m2 plus vinorelbine 25 mg/m2. GCSF 480 micrograms was administered as a single dose concomitant with chemotherapy if the WBC was between 1500 and 3500 cells/mm3. Hematological toxicity, particularly leukopenia and anemia, was the predominant adverse effect observed and was demonstrated on all three schedules. Schedule B was not feasible in that none of the seven cycles were completed and six of seven required hospitalization for febrile neutropenia. The delivery of a four-drug combination chemotherapy regimen consisting of docetaxel, cisplatin, gemcitabine, and vinorelbine is feasible with an alternating doublet multifractionated dosing scheme with either a weekly or twice weekly every other week schedule.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Pembrolizumab is an immune check-point inhibitor (ICI), which acts by blocking the T lymphocyte PD-1 inhibitor receptor. It has been increasingly used in advanced or non-responsive tumours with promising results. However, acute myocarditis is an infrequent but potentially life-threatening autoimmune adverse effect related to ICIs. CASE SUMMARY: This case deals with a 69-year-old gentleman on second-line therapy with pembrolizumab for advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Three weeks after first dose, the patient was diagnosed with an autoimmune hepatitis, treated with decreasing corticoid dosage, followed by acute heart failure. On admission, his electrocardiogram (ECG) showed diffuse repolarization changes and a transthoracic echocardiography revealed severe left ventricle impairment (left ventricular ejection fraction 32%). High-sensitivity cardiac troponin was elevated and a coronary angiogram was performed showing non-significant obstructive disease. An autoimmune myocarditis was suspected, and high-dose intravenous corticoid, intravenous vasodilators, and loop diuretics were started with favourable response. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, performed 2\\u2009weeks after clinical onset, revealed extracellular oedema in the anteroseptal-apical left ventricle segments. A new transthoracic echocardiography, performed after 3\\u2009months, showed preserved left ventricle ejection fraction. Finally, the patient was readmitted due to an autoimmune myasthenia-like syndrome. DISCUSSION: Acute autoimmune myocarditis related to ICIs is a challenging diagnosis and its incidence has been underestimated in early studies. Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) is the gold standard test for its diagnosis. Nevertheless, a definite myocarditis diagnosis is possible without EMB when characteristic clinical syndrome, elevated myonecrosis markers, and electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, and CMR changes are present together.',\n",

       "  'AB': \"An 80-year-old woman visited our hospital with a massive ulcerated tumor in the upper lateral quadrant of the right breast. Her performance status was 2. Histopathologically, a mass consisting of a huge primary tumor and metastatic axillary lymph nodes was seen and invasive ductal carcinoma was diagnosed. Both estrogen and progesterone receptors were negative. Herceptest (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) showed 2 + staining and HER2 amplification was detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization. CT revealed multiple lung metastases. Her old age and performance status of 2 made aggressive chemotherapy difficult. After receiving 5'-DFUR 600 mg/day as the first line treatment for two months, the tumors progressed. As second-line treatment, single agent therapy with a loading dose, a trastuzumab 4 mg/kg followed by 2 mg/kg weekly was recommended. The patient also received 60 Gy radiotherapy. Six months after the second line treatment, the breast tumor disappeared and only a scar remained on the chest wall and axilla. CT showed no lung tumors. During the trastuzumab treatment, no adverse effect was observed. Her performance status improved to zero, and she is alive and free from the disease 24 months after the disappearance of the tumor.\",\n",

       "  'AB': 'Background: The combination therapy of BRAF inhibitors (BRAFis) and MEK inhibitors (MEKis) has been approved as a first-line treatment for metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600 mutants. Recently, BRAF mutations have been divided into three subtypes based on biochemical and signaling characteristics. Unlike V600 mutants that show class I BRAF mutations, evidence of the effects of using BRAF inhibitors and MEK inhibitors in patients with non-V600 BRAF mutations remains unclear. The exploration of effective therapy for non-V600 BRAF mutations in melanoma has thus attracted much interest. Case presentation: We reported a case of a 64-year-old female metastatic melanoma patient with a novel BRAF p.L485-P490 deletion mutation. The patient received anti-PD1 agent pembrolizumab (100\\xa0mg) therapy as the first-line treatment for two cycles, which was terminated due to an intolerable adverse effect. Considering the p.L485-P490 deletion mutation signal as an active dimer which is akin to a class II BRAF mutation, the patient underwent dabrafenib and trametinib combination therapy as a second-line treatment. After two cycles of combination treatment, the patient achieved a partial response confirmed by radiological examinations. At the last follow-up date, the patient had obtained over 18 months of progression-free survival, and the treatment was well tolerated. Conclusion: The combination therapy of dabrafenib and trametinib has been proven to be an effective method as a later-line therapy for metastatic melanoma patients with class II BRAF in-frame deletion mutations.',\n",
