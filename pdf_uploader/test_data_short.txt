TI  - Overall Survival Benefit with Tebentafusp in Metastatic Uveal Melanoma.
PG  - 1196-1206
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa2103485 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Uveal melanoma is a disease that is distinct from cutaneous melanoma, 
      with a low tumor mutational burden and a 1-year overall survival of approximately 
      50% in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma. Data showing a proven overall 
      survival benefit with a systemic treatment are lacking. Tebentafusp is a 
      bispecific protein consisting of an affinity-enhanced T-cell receptor fused to an 
      anti-CD3 effector that can redirect T cells to target glycoprotein 100-positive 
      cells. METHODS: In this open-label, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 
      previously untreated HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with metastatic uveal melanoma 
      in a 2:1 ratio to receive tebentafusp (tebentafusp group) or the investigator's 
      choice of therapy with single-agent pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, or dacarbazine 
      (control group), stratified according to the lactate dehydrogenase level. The 
      primary end point was overall survival. RESULTS: A total of 378 patients were 
      randomly assigned to either the tebentafusp group (252 patients) or the control 
      group (126 patients). Overall survival at 1 year was 73% in the tebentafusp group 
      and 59% in the control group (hazard ratio for death, 0.51; 95% confidence 
      interval [CI], 0.37 to 0.71; P<0.001) in the intention-to-treat population. 
      Progression-free survival was also significantly higher in the tebentafusp group 
      than in the control group (31% vs. 19% at 6 months; hazard ratio for disease 
      progression or death, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.94; P = 0.01). The most common 
      treatment-related adverse events in the tebentafusp group were cytokine-mediated 
      events (due to T-cell activation) and skin-related events (due to glycoprotein 
      100-positive melanocytes), including rash (83%), pyrexia (76%), and pruritus 
      (69%). These adverse events decreased in incidence and severity after the first 
      three or four doses and infrequently led to discontinuation of the trial 
      treatment (2%). No treatment-related deaths were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment 
      with tebentafusp resulted in longer overall survival than the control therapy 
      among previously untreated patients with metastatic uveal melanoma. (Funded by

TI  - Overall Survival with Brentuximab Vedotin in Stage III or IV Hodgkin's Lymphoma.
PG  - 310-320
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa2206125 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Five-year follow-up in a trial involving patients with previously 
      untreated stage III or IV classic Hodgkin's lymphoma showed long-term 
      progression-free survival benefits with first-line therapy with brentuximab 
      vedotin, a CD30-directed antibody-drug conjugate, plus doxorubicin, vinblastine, 
      and dacarbazine (A+AVD), as compared with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, 
      and dacarbazine (ABVD). A planned interim analysis indicated a potential benefit 
      with regard to overall survival; data from a median of 6 years of follow-up are 
      now available. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
      up to six cycles of A+AVD or ABVD. The primary end point, modified 
      progression-free survival, has been reported previously. The key secondary end 
      point was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was also 
      assessed. RESULTS: A total of 664 patients were assigned to receive A+AVD and 670 
      to receive ABVD. At a median follow-up of 73.0 months, 39 patients in the A+AVD 
      group and 64 in the ABVD group had died (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence 
      interval [CI], 0.40 to 0.88; P = 0.009). The 6-year overall survival estimates 
      were 93.9% (95% CI, 91.6 to 95.5) in the A+AVD group and 89.4% (95% CI, 86.6 to 
      91.7) in the ABVD group. Progression-free survival was longer with A+AVD than 
      with ABVD (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.53 to 
      0.86). Fewer patients in the A+AVD group than in the ABVD group received 
      subsequent therapy, including transplantation, and fewer second cancers were 
      reported with A+AVD (in 23 vs. 32 patients). Primary prophylaxis with granulocyte 
      colony-stimulating factor was recommended after an increased incidence of febrile 
      neutropenia was observed with A+AVD. More patients had peripheral neuropathy with 
      A+AVD than with ABVD, but most patients in the two groups had resolution or 
      amelioration of the event by the last follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who 
      received A+AVD for the treatment of stage III or IV Hodgkin's lymphoma had a 
      survival advantage over those who received ABVD. (Funded by Takeda Development

TI  - Effect of Nivolumab vs Bevacizumab in Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma: The 
      CheckMate 143 Phase 3 Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 1003-1010
LID - 10.1001/jamaoncol.2020.1024 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Clinical outcomes for glioblastoma remain poor. Treatment with immune 
      checkpoint blockade has shown benefits in many cancer types. To our knowledge, 
      data from a randomized phase 3 clinical trial evaluating a programmed death-1 
      (PD-1) inhibitor therapy for glioblastoma have not been reported. OBJECTIVE: To 
      determine whether single-agent PD-1 blockade with nivolumab improves survival in 
      patients with recurrent glioblastoma compared with bevacizumab. DESIGN, SETTING, 
      AND PARTICIPANTS: In this open-label, randomized, phase 3 clinical trial, 439 
      patients with glioblastoma at first recurrence following standard radiation and 
      temozolomide therapy were enrolled, and 369 were randomized. Patients were 
      enrolled between September 2014 and May 2015. The median follow-up was 9.5 months 
      at data cutoff of January 20, 2017. The study included 57 multicenter, 
      multinational clinical sites. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to 
      nivolumab 3 mg/kg or bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks until confirmed disease 
      progression, unacceptable toxic effects, or death. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 
      The primary end point was overall survival (OS). RESULTS: A total of 369 patients 
      were randomized to nivolumab (n = 184) or bevacizumab (n = 185). The MGMT 
      promoter was methylated in 23.4% (43/184; nivolumab) and 22.7% (42/185; 
      bevacizumab), unmethylated in 32.1% (59/184; nivolumab) and 36.2% (67/185; 
      bevacizumab), and not reported in remaining patients. At median follow-up of 9.5 
      months, median OS (mOS) was comparable between groups: nivolumab, 9.8 months (95% 
      CI, 8.2-11.8); bevacizumab, 10.0 months (95% CI, 9.0-11.8); HR, 1.04 (95% CI, 
      0.83-1.30); P = .76. The 12-month OS was 42% in both groups. The objective 
      response rate was higher with bevacizumab (23.1%; 95% CI, 16.7%-30.5%) vs 
      nivolumab (7.8%; 95% CI, 4.1%-13.3%). Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events 
      (TRAEs) were similar between groups (nivolumab, 33/182 [18.1%]; bevacizumab, 
      25/165 [15.2%]), with no unexpected neurological TRAEs or deaths due to TRAEs. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although the primary end point was not met in this 
      randomized clinical trial, mOS was comparable between nivolumab and bevacizumab 
      in the overall patient population with recurrent glioblastoma. The safety profile 
      of nivolumab in patients with glioblastoma was consistent with that in other 
      tumor types. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02017717.

TI  - Adjuvant and concurrent temozolomide for 1p/19q non-co-deleted anaplastic glioma 
      (CATNON; EORTC study 26053-22054): second interim analysis of a randomised, 
      open-label, phase 3 study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The CATNON trial investigated the addition of concurrent, adjuvant, 
      and both current and adjuvant temozolomide to radiotherapy in adults with newly 
      diagnosed 1p/19q non-co-deleted anaplastic gliomas. The benefit of concurrent 
      temozolomide chemotherapy and relevance of mutations in the IDH1 and IDH2 genes 
      remain unclear. METHODS: This randomised, open-label, phase 3 study done in 137 
      institutions across Australia, Europe, and North America included patients aged 
      18 years or older with newly diagnosed 1p/19q non-co-deleted anaplastic gliomas 
      and a WHO performance status of 0-2. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) 
      centrally using a minimisation technique to radiotherapy alone (59·4 Gy in 33 
      fractions; three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy or intensity-modulated 
      radiotherapy), radiotherapy with concurrent oral temozolomide (75 mg/m(2) per 
      day), radiotherapy with adjuvant oral temozolomide (12 4-week cycles of 150-200 
      mg/m(2) temozolomide given on days 1-5), or radiotherapy with both concurrent and 
      adjuvant temozolomide. Patients were stratified by institution, WHO performance 
      status score, age, 1p loss of heterozygosity, the presence of oligodendroglial 
      elements on microscopy, and MGMT promoter methylation status. The primary 
      endpoint was overall survival adjusted by stratification factors at randomisation 
      in the intention-to-treat population. A second interim analysis requested by the 
      independent data monitoring committee was planned when two-thirds of total 
      required events were observed to test superiority or futility of concurrent 
      temozolomide. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00626990. 
      FINDINGS: Between Dec 4, 2007, and Sept 11, 2015, 751 patients were randomly 
      assigned (189 to radiotherapy alone, 188 to radiotherapy with concurrent 
      temozolomide, 186 to radiotherapy and adjuvant temozolomide, and 188 to 
      radiotherapy with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide). Median follow-up was 
      55·7 months (IQR 41·0-77·3). The second interim analysis declared futility of 
      concurrent temozolomide (median overall survival was 66·9 months [95% CI 
      45·7-82·3] with concurrent temozolomide vs 60·4 months [45·7-71·5] without 
      concurrent temozolomide; hazard ratio [HR] 0·97 [99·1% CI 0·73-1·28], p=0·76). By 
      contrast, adjuvant temozolomide improved overall survival compared with no 
      adjuvant temozolomide (median overall survival 82·3 months [95% CI 67·2-116·6] vs 
      46·9 months [37·9-56·9]; HR 0·64 [95% CI 0·52-0·79], p<0·0001). The most frequent 
      grade 3 and 4 toxicities were haematological, occurring in no patients in the 
      radiotherapy only group, 16 (9%) of 185 patients in the concurrent temozolomide 
      group, and 55 (15%) of 368 patients in both groups with adjuvant temozolomide. No 
      treatment-related deaths were reported. INTERPRETATION: Adjuvant temozolomide 
      chemotherapy, but not concurrent temozolomide chemotherapy, was associated with a 
      survival benefit in patients with 1p/19q non-co-deleted anaplastic glioma. 
      Clinical benefit was dependent on IDH1 and IDH2 mutational status. FUNDING: Merck 
      Sharpe & Dohme.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma is a highly vascularised tumour and there are few 
      treatment options after disease recurrence. Regorafenib is an oral multikinase 
      inhibitor of angiogenic, stromal, and oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases. We 
      aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of regorafenib in the treatment of 
      recurrent glioblastoma. METHODS: REGOMA is a randomised, multicentre, open-label 
      phase 2 trial done in ten centres in Italy. Eligible patients (aged ≥18 years) 
      with histologically confirmed glioblastoma, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
      performance status 0 or 1, and documented disease progression after surgery 
      followed by radiotherapy and temozolomide chemoradiotherapy were randomly 
      assigned (1:1) by a web-based system, stratified by centre and surgery at 
      recurrence (yes vs no), to receive regorafenib 160 mg once daily for the first 3 
      weeks of each 4-week cycle or lomustine 110 mg/m(2) once every 6 weeks until 
      disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal. The 
      primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. This 
      trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02926222, and is currently in 
      follow-up. FINDINGS: Between Nov 27, 2015, and Feb 23, 2017, 124 patients were 
      screened and 119 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive regorafenib 
      (n=59) or lomustine (n=60). Median follow-up was 15·4 months (IQR 13·8-18·1). At 
      the analysis cutoff date, 99 (83%) of 119 patients had died: 42 (71%) of 59 in 
      the regorafenib group and 57 (95%) of 60 in the lomustine group. Overall survival 
      was significantly improved in the regorafenib group compared with the lomustine 
      group, with a median overall survival of 7·4 months (95% CI 5·8-12·0) in the 
      regorafenib group and 5·6 months (4·7-7·3) in the lomustine group (hazard ratio 
      0·50, 95% CI 0·33-0·75; log-rank p=0·0009). Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse 
      events occurred in 33 (56%) of 59 patients treated with regorafenib and 24 (40%) 
      of 60 with lomustine. The most frequent grade 3 or 4 adverse events related to 
      regorafenib were hand-foot skin reaction, increased lipase, and blood bilirubin 
      increased (in six [10%] of 59 patients each). In the lomustine group, the most 
      common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were decreased platelet count (eight [13%] of 
      60 patients), decreased lymphocyte count (eight [13%]), and neutropenia (seven 
      [12%]). No death was considered by the investigators to be drug related. 
      INTERPRETATION: REGOMA showed an encouraging overall survival benefit of 
      regorafenib in recurrent glioblastoma. This drug might be a new potential 
      treatment for these patients and should be investigated in an adequately powered 
      phase 3 study. FUNDING: Veneto Institute of Oncology and Bayer Italy.

TI  - Brentuximab Vedotin Plus AVD for First-Line Treatment of Early-Stage Unfavorable 
      Hodgkin Lymphoma (BREACH): A Multicenter, Open-Label, Randomized, Phase II Trial.
PG  - 327-335
LID - 10.1200/JCO.21.01281 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The prognosis of patients with early-stage unfavorable Hodgkin lymphoma 
      remains unsatisfactory. We assessed the efficacy and safety of brentuximab 
      vedotin plus doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (BV-AVD) in previously 
      untreated, early-stage unfavorable Hodgkin lymphoma (ClinicalTrials.gov 
      identifier: NCT02292979). METHODS: BREACH is a multicenter, randomized, 
      open-label, phase II trial. Eligible patients were age 18-60 years with ≥ 1 
      unfavorable EORTC/LYSA criterion. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to four 
      cycles of BV-AVD or standard doxorubicin, bleomycin, vincristine, and dacarbazine 
      (ABVD), followed by 30 Gy involved node radiotherapy. The primary end point was 
      the positron emission tomography (PET) response rate after two cycles by expert 
      independent review using the Deauville score. The study was designed to test if 
      the PET-negative rate after two cycles of BV-AVD was superior to 75%. We 
      hypothesized a 10% increase in the PET-negative rate after two cycles of BV-AVD. 
      RESULTS: Between March 2015 and October 2016, 170 patients were enrolled. After 
      two cycles, the primary end point of the study was met: 93 (82.3%; 90% CI, 75.3 
      to 88.0) of 113 patients in the BV-AVD arm were PET-negative (Deauville score 
      1-3) compared with 43 (75.4%; 90% CI, 64.3% to 84.5%) of 57 in the ABVD arm. The 
      2-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 97.3% (95% CI, 91.9 to 99.1) and 92.6% 
      (95% CI, 81.4% to 97.2%) in the BV-AVD and ABVD arms, respectively. High total 
      metabolic tumor volume was associated with a significantly shorter PFS (hazard 
      ratio, 17.9; 95% CI, 2.2 to 145.5; P < .001). For patients with high total 
      metabolic tumor volume, the 2-year PFS rate was 90.9% (95% CI, 74.4 to 97.0) and 
      70.7% (95% CI, 39.4% to 87.9%) in the BV-AVD and ABVD arms, respectively. 
      CONCLUSION: BV-AVD demonstrated an improvement in the PET-negative rate compared 
      with ABVD after two cycles.

TI  - Brentuximab vedotin with chemotherapy for stage III/IV classical Hodgkin 
      lymphoma: 3-year update of the ECHELON-1 study.
PG  - 735-742
LID - 10.1182/blood.2019003127 [doi]
AB  - The phase 3 ECHELON-1 study demonstrated that brentuximab vedotin (A) with 
      doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (AVD; A+AVD) exhibited superior 
      modified progression-free survival (PFS) vs doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, 
      and dacarbazine (ABVD) for frontline treatment of patients with stage III/IV 
      classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). Maturing positron emission tomography 
      (PET)-adapted trial data highlight potential limitations of PET-adapted 
      approaches, including toxicities with dose intensification and 
      higher-than-expected relapse rates in PET scan after cycle 2 (PET2)-negative 
      (PET2-) patients. We present an update of the ECHELON-1 study, including an 
      exploratory analysis of 3-year PFS per investigator. A total of 1334 patients 
      with stage III or IV cHL were randomized 1:1 to receive 6 cycles of A+AVD (n = 
      664) or ABVD (n = 670). Interim PET2 was required. At median follow-up of 37 
      months, 3-year PFS rates were 83.1% with A+AVD and 76.0% with ABVD; 3-year PFS 
      rates in PET2- patients aged <60 years were 87.2% vs 81.0%, respectively. A 
      beneficial trend in PET2+ patients aged <60 years on A+AVD was also observed, 
      with a 3-year PFS rate of 69.2% vs 54.7% with ABVD. The benefit of A+AVD in the 
      intent-to-treat population appeared independent of disease stage and prognostic 
      risk factors. Upon continued follow-up, 78% of patients with peripheral 
      neuropathy on A+AVD had either complete resolution or improvement compared with 
      83% on ABVD. These data highlight that A+AVD provides a durable efficacy benefit 
      compared with ABVD for frontline stage III/IV cHL, consistent across key 
      subgroups regardless of patient status at PET2, without need for treatment 
      intensification or bleomycin exposure. This trial was registered at 
      www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01712490 (EudraCT no. 2011-005450-60).

      chemotherapy in children and adolescents with intermediate-stage and 
      advanced-stage classical Hodgkin lymphoma (EuroNet-PHL-C1): a titration study 
      with an open-label, embedded, multinational, non-inferiority, randomised 
      controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Children and adolescents with intermediate-stage and advanced-stage 
      classical Hodgkin lymphoma achieve an event-free survival at 5 years of about 90% 
      after treatment with vincristine, etoposide, prednisone, and doxorubicin (OEPA) 
      followed by cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, and procarbazine (COPP) 
      and radiotherapy, but long-term treatment effects affect survival and quality of 
      life. We aimed to investigate whether radiotherapy can be omitted in patients 
      with morphological and metabolic adequate response to OEPA and whether modified 
      consolidation chemotherapy reduces gonadotoxicity. METHODS: Our study was 
      designed as a titration study with an open-label, embedded, multinational, 
      non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial, and was carried out at 186 hospital 
      sites across 16 European countries. Children and adolescents with newly diagnosed 
      intermediate-stage (treatment group 2) and advanced-stage (treatment group 3) 
      classical Hodgkin lymphoma who were younger than 18 years and stratified 
      according to risk using Ann Arbor disease stages IIAE, IIB, IIBE, IIIA, IIIAE, 
      IIIB, IIIBE, and all stages IV (A, B, AE, and BE) were included in the study. 
      Patients with early disease (treatment group 1) were excluded from this analysis. 
      All patients were treated with two cycles of OEPA (1·5 mg/m(2) vincristine taken 
      intravenously capped at 2 mg, on days 1, 8, and 15; 125 mg/m(2) etoposide taken 
      intravenously on days 1-5; 60 mg/m(2) prednisone taken orally on days 1-15; and 
      40 mg/m(2) doxorubicin taken intravenously on days 1 and 15). Patients were 
      randomly assigned to two (treatment group 2) or four (treatment group 3) cycles 
      of COPP (500 mg/m(2) cyclophosphamide taken intravenously on days 1 and 8; 1·5 
      mg/m(2) vincristine taken intravenously capped at 2 mg, on days 1 and 8; 40 
      mg/m(2) prednisone taken orally on days 1 to 15; and 100 mg/m(2) procarbazine 
      taken orally on days 1 to 15) or COPDAC, which was identical to COPP except that 
      250 mg/m(2) dacarbazine administered intravenously on days 1 to 3 replaced 
      procarbazine. The method of randomisation (1:1) was minimisation with stochastic 
      component and was centrally stratified by treatment group, country, trial sites, 
      and sex. The primary endpoint was event-free survival, defined as time from 
      treatment start until the first of the following events: death from any cause, 
      progression or relapse of classical Hodgkin lymphoma, or occurrence of secondary 
      malignancy. The primary objectives were maintaining 90% event-free survival at 5 
      years in patients with adequate response to OEPA treated without radiotherapy and 
      to exclude a decrease of 8% in event-free survival at 5 years in the embedded 
      COPDAC versus COPP randomisation to show non-inferiority of COPDAC. Efficacy 
      analyses are reported per protocol and safety in the intention-to-treat 
      population. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (trial number 
      NCT00433459) and EUDRACT (trial number 2006-000995-33), and is closed to 
      recruitment. FINDINGS: Between Jan 31, 2007, and Jan 30, 2013, 2102 patients were 
      recruited. 737 (35%) of the 2102 recruited patients were in treatment group 1 
      (early-stage disease) and were not included in our analysis. 1365 (65%) of the 
      2102 patients were in treatment group 2 (intermediate-stage disease; n=455) and 
      treatment group 3 (advanced-stage disease; n=910). Of these 1365, 1287 (94%) 
      patients (435 [34%] of 1287 in treatment group 2 and 852 [66%] of 1287 in 
      treatment group 3) were included in the titration trial per-protocol analysis. 
      937 (69%) of 1365 patients were randomly assigned to COPP (n=471) or COPDAC 
      (n=466) in the embedded trial. Median follow-up was 66·5 months (IQR 62·7-71·7). 
      Of 1287 patients in the per-protocol group, 514 (40%) had an adequate response to 
      treatment and were not treated with radiotherapy (215 [49%] of 435 in treatment 
      group 2 and 299 [35%] of 852 in treatment group 3). 773 (60%) of 1287 patients 
      with inadequate response were scheduled for radiotherapy (220 [51%] of 435 in the 
      treatment group 2 and 553 [65%] of 852 in treatment group 3. In patients who 
      responded adequately, event-free survival rates at 5 years were 90·1% (95% CI 
      87·5-92·7). event-free survival rates at 5 years in 892 patients who were 
      randomly assigned to treatment and analysed per protocol were 89·9% (95% CI 
      87·1-92·8) for COPP (n=444) versus 86·1% (82·9-89·4) for COPDAC (n=448). The 
      COPDAC minus COPP difference in event-free survival at 5 years was -3·7% (-8·0 to 
      0·6). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events (intention-to-treat population) 
      were decreased haemoglobin (205 [15%] of 1365 patients during OEPA vs 37 [7%] of 
      528 treated with COPP vs 20 [2%] of 819 treated with COPDAC), decreased white 
      blood cells (815 [60%] vs 231 [44%] vs 84 [10%]), and decreased neutrophils (1160 
      [85%] vs 223 [42%] vs 174 [21%]). One patient in treatment group 2 died of sepsis 
      after the first cycle of OEPA; no other treatment-related deaths occurred. 
      INTERPRETATION: Our results show that radiotherapy can be omitted in patients who 
      adequately respond to treatment, when consolidated with COPP or COPDAC. COPDAC 
      might be less effective, but is substantially less gonadotoxic than COPP. A high 
      proportion of patients could therefore be spared radiotherapy, eventually 
      reducing the late effects of treatment. With more refined criteria for response 
      assessment, the number of patients who receive radiotherapy will be further 
      decreased. FUNDING: Deutsche Krebshilfe, Elternverein für Krebs-und

TI  - Five-Year Outcomes With Nivolumab in Patients With Wild-Type BRAF Advanced 
      Melanoma.
PG  - 3937-3946
LID - 10.1200/JCO.20.00995 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The CheckMate 066 trial investigated nivolumab monotherapy as first-line 
      treatment for patients with previously untreated BRAF wild-type advanced 
      melanoma. Five-year results are presented herein. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this 
      multicenter, double-blind, phase III study, 418 patients with previously 
      untreated, unresectable, stage III/IV, wild-type BRAF melanoma were randomly 
      assigned 1:1 to receive nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks or dacarbazine 1,000 
      mg/m(2) every 3 weeks. The primary end point was overall survival (OS), and 
      secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS), objective response 
      rate (ORR), and safety. RESULTS: Patients were followed for a minimum of 60 
      months from the last patient randomly assigned (median follow-up, 32.0 months for 
      nivolumab and 10.9 months for dacarbazine). Five-year OS rates were 39% with 
      nivolumab and 17% with dacarbazine; PFS rates were 28% and 3%, respectively. 
      Five-year OS was 38% in patients randomly assigned to dacarbazine who had 
      subsequent therapy, including nivolumab (n = 37). ORR was 42% with nivolumab and 
      14% with dacarbazine; among patients alive at 5 years, ORR was 81% and 39%, 
      respectively. Of 42 patients treated with nivolumab who had a complete response 
      (20%), 88% (37 of 42) were alive as of the 5-year analysis. Among 75 
      nivolumab-treated patients alive and evaluable at the 5-year analysis, 83% had 
      not received subsequent therapy; 23% were still on study treatment, and 60% were 
      treatment free. Safety analyses were similar to the 3-year report. CONCLUSION: 
      Results from this 5-year analysis confirm the significant benefit of nivolumab 
      over dacarbazine for all end points and add to the growing body of evidence 
      supporting long-term survival with nivolumab mono-therapy. Survival is strongly 
      associated with achieving a durable response, which can be maintained after 
      treatment discontinuation, even without subsequent systemic therapies.

TI  - Efficacy of Nivolumab and AVD in Early-Stage Unfavorable Classic Hodgkin 
      Lymphoma: The Randomized Phase 2 German Hodgkin Study Group NIVAHL Trial.
PG  - 872-880
LID - 10.1001/jamaoncol.2020.0750 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: In early-stage unfavorable classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), 
      conventional therapy induces high cure rates but also relevant acute and 
      long-term toxic effects. Nivolumab is well tolerated and highly effective in 
      relapsed/refractory cHL but has not been adequately studied in first-line 
      treatment of early-stage cHL. The NIVAHL trial evaluated nivolumab in this 
      setting with the aim to develop a highly effective yet tolerable systemic therapy 
      to ultimately mitigate morbidity in patients who survive cHL. OBJECTIVE: To 
      evaluate efficacy of 2 experimental nivolumab-based first-line treatment 
      strategies in patients with early-stage unfavorable cHL. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: This was an open-label, multicenter, phase 2 randomized clinical 
      trial, open between April 2017 and October 2018. The trial took place at 35 trial 
      centers across Germany, ranging from academic centers to private offices. 
      Eligibility was defined by age 18 to 60 years, cHL confirmed by expert pathology 
      review, early-stage unfavorable disease by German Hodgkin Study Group criteria 
      (stage I to II with risk factor[s]), and absence of serious concomitant disease 
      or organ dysfunction. Among 110 enrolled patients, 109 were eligible. 
      INTERVENTIONS: Systemic therapy, per random assignment (1:1) to either 
      concomitant treatment with 4 cycles of nivolumab and doxorubicin, vinblastine, 
      and dacarbazine (N-AVD) or sequential treatment with 4 doses of nivolumab, 2 
      cycles of N-AVD, and 2 cycles of AVD at standard doses, followed by 30-Gy 
      involved-site radiotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Complete remission (CR) 
      rate after study treatment, aiming at excluding a CR rate of 80% or lower via a 
      2-sided 95% CI for each treatment group. RESULTS: Of 109 patients included in 
      this study, 65 (59.6%) were women, and the median (range) age was 27 (18-60) 
      years. At interim staging after 2 cycles of N-AVD or 4 doses of nivolumab 
      monotherapy, 54 of 54 (100%) and 49 of 51 (96%) response-eligible patients, 
      respectively, achieved an objective response, with CR in 47 (87%) and 26 (51%) 
      patients, respectively. Among 101 patients eligible for primary end point 
      analysis, 46 of 51 (90%; 95% CI, 79%-97%) patients receiving concomitant therapy 
      and 47 of 50 (94%; 95% CI, 84%-99%) patients receiving sequential therapy 
      achieved CR after study treatment. With a median follow-up of 13 months, 12-month 
      progression-free survival was 100% for patients receiving concomitant treatment 
      and 98% (95% CI, 95%-100%) for patients receiving sequential therapy. CONCLUSIONS 
      AND RELEVANCE: Both strategies combining nivolumab and AVD are feasible and 
      resulted in high remission rates. Despite narrowly missing the efficacy benchmark 
      in the concomitant group, the excellent 12-month progression-free survival and 
      the unexpectedly high CR rate after 4 doses of nivolumab monotherapy warrant 
      further evaluation of this approach in the first-line treatment of patients with 
      early-stage cHL. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03004833.

TI  - Survival Outcomes in Patients With Previously Untreated BRAF Wild-Type Advanced 
      Melanoma Treated With Nivolumab Therapy: Three-Year Follow-up of a Randomized 
      Phase 3 Trial.
PG  - 187-194
LID - 10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.4514 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: This analysis provides long-term follow-up in patients with BRAF 
      wild-type advanced melanoma receiving first-line therapy based on anti-programmed 
      cell death 1 receptor inhibitors. OBJECTIVE: To compare the 3-year survival with 
      nivolumab vs that with dacarbazine in patients with previously untreated BRAF 
      wild-type advanced melanoma. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This follow-up of 
      a randomized phase 3 trial analyzed 3-year overall survival data from the 
      randomized, controlled, double-blind CheckMate 066 phase 3 clinical trial. For 
      this ongoing, multicenter academic institution trial, patients were enrolled from 
      January 2013 through February 2014. Eligible patients were 18 years or older with 
      confirmed unresectable previously untreated stage III or IV melanoma and an 
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 but without a 
      BRAF mutation. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were treated until progression or 
      unacceptable toxic events with nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus 
      dacarbazine-matched placebo every 3 weeks) or dacarbazine (1000 mg/m2 every 3 
      weeks plus nivolumab-matched placebo every 2 weeks). MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: 
      Overall survival. RESULTS: At minimum follow-ups of 38.4 months among 210 
      participants in the nivolumab group (median age, 64 years [range, 18-86 years]; 
      57.6% male) and 38.5 months among 208 participants in the dacarbazine group 
      (median age, 66 years [range, 25-87 years]; 60.1% male), 3-year overall survival 
      rates were 51.2% (95% CI, 44.1%-57.9%) and 21.6% (95% CI, 16.1%-27.6%), 
      respectively. The median overall survival was 37.5 months (95% CI, 25.5 
      months-not reached) in the nivolumab group and 11.2 months (95% CI, 9.6-13.0 
      months) in the dacarbazine group (hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.36-0.59; 
      P < .001). Complete and partial responses, respectively, were reported for 19.0% 
      (40 of 210) and 23.8% (50 of 210) of patients in the nivolumab group compared 
      with 1.4% (3 of 208) and 13.0% (27 of 208) of patients in the dacarbazine group. 
      Additional analyses were performed on outcomes with subsequent therapies. 
      Treatment-related grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in 15.0% (31 of 206) of 
      nivolumab-treated patients and in 17.6% (36 of 205) of dacarbazine-treated 
      patients. There were no deaths due to study drug toxic effects. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: Nivolumab led to improved 3-year overall survival vs dacarbazine in 
      patients with previously untreated BRAF wild-type advanced melanoma. TRIAL

TI  - Positron Emission Tomography-Guided Treatment in Early-Stage Favorable Hodgkin 
      Lymphoma: Final Results of the International, Randomized Phase III HD16 Trial by 
      the German Hodgkin Study Group.
PG  - 2835-2845
LID - 10.1200/JCO.19.00964 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Combined-modality treatment (CMT) with 2× ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, 
      vinblastine, and dacarbazine) and small-field radiotherapy is standard of care 
      for patients with early-stage favorable Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). However, the role 
      of radiotherapy has been challenged. Positron emission tomography (PET) after 2× 
      ABVD (PET-2) might help to predict individual outcomes and guide treatment. 
      METHODS: Between November 2009 and December 2015, we recruited patients age 18 to 
      75 years with newly diagnosed, early-stage favorable HL for this international 
      randomized phase III trial. Patients were assigned to standard CMT of 2× ABVD and 
      20-Gy involved-field radiotherapy or PET-guided treatment, omitting 
      involved-field radiotherapy after negative PET-2 (Deauville score < 3). Primary 
      objectives were to exclude inferiority of 10% or more in 5-year progression-free 
      survival (PFS) of ABVD alone compared with CMT in a per-protocol analysis among 
      PET-2-negative patients (noninferiority margin for hazard ratio, 3.01) and to 
      confirm PET-2 positivity (Deauville score ≥ 3) as a risk factor for PFS among 
      CMT-treated patients. RESULTS: We enrolled 1,150 patients. Median follow-up was 
      45 months. Among 628 PET-2-negative, per-protocol-treated patients, 5-year PFS 
      was 93.4% (95% CI, 90.4% to 96.5%) with CMT and 86.1% (95% CI, 81.4% to 90.9%) 
      with ABVD (difference 7.3% [95% CI, 1.6% to 13.0%]; hazard ratio, 1.78 [95% CI, 
      1.02 to 3.12]). Five-year overall survival was 98.1% (95% CI, 96.5% to 99.8%) 
      with CMT and 98.4% (95% CI, 96.5% to 100.0%) with ABVD. Among 693 patients who 
      were assigned to CMT, 5-year PFS was 93.2% (95% CI, 90.2% to 96.2%) among 
      PET-2-negative patients and 88.4% (95% CI, 84.2% to 92.6%) in PET-2-positive 
      patients (P = .047). When using the more common liver cutoff (Deauville score, 4) 
      for PET-2 positivity, the difference was more pronounced (5-year PFS, 93.1% [95% 
      CI, 90.7% to 95.5%] v 80.9% [95% CI, 72.2% to 89.7%]; P = .0011). CONCLUSION: In 
      early-stage favorable HL, a positive PET after two cycles ABVD indicates a high 
      risk for treatment failure, particularly when a Deauville score of 4 is used as a 
      cutoff for positivity. In PET-2-negative patients, radiotherapy cannot be omitted 
      from CMT without clinically relevant loss of tumor control.

TI  - Patterns, predictors and prognostic relevance of high-grade hematotoxicity after 
      temozolomide or temozolomide-lomustine in the CeTeG/NOA-09 trial.
PG  - 147-153
LID - 10.1007/s11060-022-04203-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: In the randomized phase III trial CeTeG/NOA-09, temozolomide 
      (TMZ)/lomustine (CCNU) combination therapy was superior to TMZ in newly diagnosed 
      MGMT methylated glioblastoma, albeit reporting more frequent hematotoxicity. 
      Here, we analyze high grade hematotoxicity and its prognostic relevance in the 
      trial population. METHODS: Descriptive and comparative analysis of hematotoxicity 
      adverse events ≥ grade 3 (HAE) according to the Common Terminology of Clinical 
      Adverse Events, version 4.0 was performed. The association of HAE with survival 
      was assessed in a landmark analysis. Logistic regression analysis was performed 
      to predict HAE during the concomitant phase of chemotherapy. RESULTS: HAE 
      occurred in 36.4% and 28.6% of patients under CCNU/TMZ and TMZ treatment, 
      respectively. The median onset of the first HAE was during concomitant 
      chemotherapy (i.e. first CCNU/TMZ course or daily TMZ therapy), and 42.9% of 
      patients with HAE receiving further courses experienced repeat HAE. Median HAE 
      duration was similar between treatment arms (CCNU/TMZ 11.5; TMZ 13 days). 
      Chemotherapy was more often discontinued due to HAE in CCNU/TMZ than in TMZ (19.7 
      vs. 6.3%, p = 0.036). The occurrence of HAE was not associated with survival 
      differences (p = 0.76). Regression analysis confirmed older age (OR 1.08) and 
      female sex (OR 2.47), but not treatment arm, as predictors of HAE. CONCLUSION: 
      Older age and female sex are associated with higher incidence of HAE. Although 
      occurrence of HAE was not associated with shorter survival, reliable prediction 
      of patients at risk might be beneficial to allow optimal management of therapy 
      and allocation of supportive measures. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01149109.

TI  - Bevacizumab and temozolomide in patients with first recurrence of WHO grade II

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab is frequently used in the treatment of recurrent WHO 
      grade II and III glioma, but without supporting evidence from randomised trials. 
      Therefore, we assessed the use of bevacizumab in patients with first recurrence 
      of grade II or III glioma who did not have 1p/19q co-deletion. METHODS: The 
      TAVAREC trial was a randomised, open-label phase 2 trial done at 32 centres 
      across Europe in patients with locally diagnosed grade II or III glioma without 
      1p/19q co-deletion, with a first and contrast-enhancing recurrence after initial 
      radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or both. Previous chemotherapy must have been 
      stopped at least 6 months before enrolment and radiotherapy must have been 
      stopped at least 3 months before enrolment. Random group assignment was done 
      electronically through the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of 
      Cancer web-based system, stratified by a minimisation procedure using 
      institution, initial histology (WHO grade II vs III), WHO performance status (0 
      or 1 vs 2), and previous treatment (radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or both). 
      Patients were assigned to receive either temozolomide (150-200 mg/m(2), orally) 
      monotherapy on days 1-5 every 4 weeks for a maximum of 12 cycles, or the same 
      temozolomide regimen in combination with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg, intravenously) 
      every 2 weeks until progression. The primary endpoint was overall survival at 12 
      months in the per-protocol population. Safety analyses were done in all patients 
      who started their allocated treatment. The study is registered at EudraCT 
      (2009-017422-39) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01164189), and is complete. FINDINGS: 
      Between Feb 8, 2011, and July 31, 2015, 155 patients were enrolled and randomly 
      assigned to receive either monotherapy (n=77) or combination therapy (n=78). 
      Overall survival in the per-protocol population at 12 months was achieved by 44 
      (61% [80% CI 53-69]) of 72 patients in the temozolomide group and 38 (55% 
      [47-69]) of 69 in the combination group. The most frequent toxicity was 
      haematological: 17 (23%) of 75 patients in the monotherapy group and 25 (33%) of 
      76 in the combination group developed grade 3 or 4 haematological toxicity. Other 
      than haematological toxicities, the most common adverse events were nervous 
      system disorders (59 [79%] of 75 patients in the monotherapy group vs 65 [86%] of 
      76 in the combination group), fatigue (53 [70%] vs 61 [80%]), and nausea (39 
      [52%] vs 43 [56%]). Infections were more frequently reported in the combination 
      group (29 [38%] of 76 patients) than in the monotherapy group (17 [23%] of 75). 
      One treatment-related death was reported in the combination group (infection 
      after intratumoral haemorrhage during a treatment-related grade 4 
      thrombocytopenia). INTERPRETATION: We found no evidence of improved overall 
      survival with bevacizumab and temozolomide combination treatment versus 
      temozolomide monotherapy. The findings from this study provide no support for 
      further phase 3 studies on the role of bevacizumab in this disease. FUNDING:

TI  - The cost-effectiveness of nivolumab monotherapy for the treatment of advanced 
      melanoma patients in England.
PG  - 1163-1172

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nivolumab was the first programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) immune 
      checkpoint inhibitor to demonstrate long-term survival benefit in a clinical 
      trial setting for advanced melanoma patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost 
      effectiveness of nivolumab monotherapy for the treatment of advanced melanoma 
      patients in England. METHODS: A Markov state-transition model was developed to 
      estimate the lifetime costs and benefits of nivolumab versus ipilimumab and 
      dacarbazine for BRAF mutation-negative patients and versus ipilimumab, 
      dabrafenib, and vemurafenib for BRAF mutation-positive patients. 
      Covariate-adjusted parametric curves for time to progression, pre-progression 
      survival, and post-progression survival were fitted based on patient-level data 
      from two trials and long-term ipilimumab survival data. Indirect treatment 
      comparisons between nivolumab, ipilimumab, and dacarbazine were informed by these 
      covariate-adjusted parametric curves, controlling for differences in patient 
      characteristics. Kaplan-Meier data from the literature were digitised and used to 
      fit progression-free and overall survival curves for dabrafenib and vemurafenib. 
      Patient utilities and resource use data were based on trial data or the 
      literature. Patients are assumed to receive nivolumab until there is no further 
      clinical benefit, assumed to be the first of progressive disease, unacceptable 
      toxicity, or 2 years of treatment. RESULTS: Nivolumab is the most cost-effective 
      treatment option in BRAF mutation-negative and mutation-positive patients, with 
      incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of £24,483 and £17,362 per quality-adjusted 
      life year, respectively. The model results are most sensitive to assumptions 
      regarding treatment duration for nivolumab and the parameters of the fitted 
      parametric survival curves. CONCLUSIONS: Nivolumab is a cost-effective treatment 
      for advanced melanoma patients in England.

TI  - Eribulin versus dacarbazine in patients with leiomyosarcoma: subgroup analysis 
      from a phase 3, open-label, randomised study.
PG  - 1026-1032
LID - 10.1038/s41416-019-0462-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This subgroup analysis of a phase 3 study compares outcomes for 
      eribulin versus dacarbazine in patients with leiomyosarcoma. METHODS: Patients 
      ≥18 years old with advanced liposarcoma or leiomyosarcoma, ECOG PS ≤2, and ≥2 
      prior treatment regimens were randomly assigned (1:1) to eribulin mesylate 
      (1.4 mg/m² intravenously on day 1 and day 8) or dacarbazine (either 850, 1000, or 
      1200 mg/m² intravenously) every 21 days until disease progression. The primary 
      end point was OS; additional end points were progression-free survival (PFS) and 
      objective response rate (ORR). RESULTS: 309 Patients with leiomyosarcoma were 
      included (eribulin, n = 157; dacarbazine, n = 152). Median age was 57 years; 42% 
      of patients had uterine disease and 57% had nonuterine disease. Median OS was 
      12.7 versus 13.0 months for eribulin versus dacarbazine, respectively (hazard 
      ratio [HR] = 0.93 [95% CI 0.71-1.20]; P = 0.57). Median PFS (2.2 vs 2.6 months, 
      HR = 1.07 [95% CI 0.84-1.38]; P = 0.58) and ORR (5% vs 7%) were similar between 
      eribulin- and dacarbazine-treated patients. Grade ≥3 TEAEs occurred in 69% of 
      patients receiving eribulin and 59% of patients receiving dacarbazine. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Efficacy of eribulin in patients with leiomyosarcoma was comparable 
      to that of dacarbazine. Both agents had manageable safety profiles.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of trabectedin in elderly patients with sarcoma: 
      subgroup analysis from a phase III, randomized controlled study of trabectedin or 
      dacarbazine in patients with advanced liposarcoma or leiomyosarcoma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment options for soft tissue sarcoma (STS) patients aged 
      ≥65 years (elderly) can be limited by concerns regarding the increased risk of 
      toxicity associated with standard systemic therapies. Trabectedin has 
      demonstrated improved disease control in a phase III trial (ET743-SAR-3007) of 
      patients with advanced liposarcoma or leiomyosarcoma after failure of 
      anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Since previous retrospective analyses have 
      suggested that trabectedin has similar safety and efficacy outcomes regardless of 
      patient age, we carried out a subgroup analysis of the safety and efficacy 
      observed in elderly patients enrolled in this trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      Patients were randomized 2 : 1 to trabectedin (n = 384) or dacarbazine (n = 193) 
      administered intravenously every-3-weeks. The primary end point was overall 
      survival (OS); secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS), 
      time-to-progression, objective response rate (ORR), duration of response, symptom 
      severity, and safety. A post hoc analysis was conducted in the elderly patient 
      subgroup. RESULTS: Among 131 (trabectedin = 94; dacarbazine = 37) elderly 
      patients, disease characteristics were well-balanced and consistent with those of 
      the total study population. Treatment exposure was longer in patients treated 
      with trabectedin versus dacarbazine (median four versus two cycles, 
      respectively), with a significantly higher proportion receiving prolonged therapy 
      (≥6 cycles) in the trabectedin arm (43% versus 23%, respectively; P = 0.04). 
      Elderly patients treated with trabectedin showed significantly improved PFS [4.9 
      versus 1.5 months, respectively; hazard ratio (HR)=0.40; P = 0.0002] but no 
      statistically significant improvement in OS (15.1 versus 8.0 months, 
      respectively; HR = 0.72; P = 0.18) or ORR (9% versus 3%, respectively; P = 0.43). 
      The safety profile for elderly trabectedin-treated patients was comparable to 
      that of the overall trabectedin-treated study population. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      subgroup analysis of the elderly population of ET743-SAR-3007 suggests that 
      elderly patients with STS and good performance status can expect clinical benefit 
      from trabectedin similar to that observed in younger patients. TRIAL

TI  - Temozolomide and seizure outcomes in a randomized clinical trial of elderly 
      glioblastoma patients.
PG  - 65-71
LID - 10.1007/s11060-020-03573-x [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Tumor-related epilepsy may respond to chemotherapy. In a 
      previously-published multi-centre randomized clinical trial of 562 elderly 
      glioblastoma patients, temozolomide plus short-course radiotherapy conferred a 
      survival benefit over radiotherapy alone. Seizure outcomes were not reported. 
      METHODS: We performed an unplanned secondary analysis of this trial's data. The 
      trial design has been previously reported. Seizures were recorded by clinicians 
      as adverse events and by patients in quality of life questionnaires. A Chi-square 
      test of seizure rates between the two groups (α = 0.05) and a Kaplan-Meier 
      estimator of time-to-first self-reported seizure were planned. RESULTS: Almost 
      all patients were followed until they died. In the radiotherapy alone group, 68 
      patients (24%) had a documented or self-reported seizure versus 83 patients (30%) 
      in the temozolomide plus radiotherapy group, Chi-square analysis showed no 
      difference (p = 0.15). Patients receiving radiotherapy alone tended to develop 
      seizures earlier than those receiving temozolomide plus radiotherapy (p = 0.054). 
      Patients with seizures had shorter overall survival than those without seizures 
      (hazard ratio 1.24, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: This study was not powered to detect 
      differences in seizure outcomes, but temozolomide seemed to have minimal impact 
      on seizure control in elderly patients with glioblastoma. CLINICAL TRIAL

TI  - Nivolumab and Doxorubicin, Vinblastine, and Dacarbazine in Early-Stage 
      Unfavorable Hodgkin Lymphoma: Final Analysis of the Randomized German Hodgkin 
      Study Group Phase II NIVAHL Trial.
PG  - 1193-1199
LID - 10.1200/JCO.22.02355 [doi]
AB  - Clinical trials frequently include multiple end points that mature at different 
      times. The initial report, typically based on the primary end point, may be 
      published when key planned co-primary or secondary analyses are not yet 
      available. Clinical Trial Updates provide an opportunity to disseminate 
      additional results from studies, published in JCO or elsewhere, for which the 
      primary end point has already been reported.In the investigator-sponsored 
      randomized phase II NIVAHL trial for early-stage unfavorable classical Hodgkin 
      lymphoma (HL), two schedules of four cycles of nivolumab, doxorubicin, 
      vinblastine, and dacarbazine followed by 30 Gy involved-site radiotherapy 
      resulted in high complete remission rates and an unprecedented 1-year 
      progression-free survival in 109 patients. In this article, we report the 
      preplanned final analysis conducted three years after the registration of the 
      last patient including long-term safety results. No survival events were observed 
      since the primary analysis, and after a median follow-up (FU) of 41 months, the 
      overall survival was 100% in both treatment groups. The progression-free survival 
      was 98% and 100% in the sequential and concomitant nivolumab, doxorubicin, 
      vinblastine, and dacarbazine treatment groups, respectively. At last FU, the mean 
      forced expiratory pressure in one second was 95.5% (standard deviation 12.7%), 
      the mean diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide adjusted for hemoglobin was 82.8% 
      (standard deviation 15.4%), and the left ventricular ejection fraction was in the 
      normal range in 95% of patients. Hypothyroidism requiring long-term medication 
      occurred in 15% of patients, who were nearly exclusively female (87%). No second 
      primary malignancies occurred, and no patient required corticosteroid treatment 
      at last FU. Patient-reported normalized global quality-of-life score measured by 
      European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life 
      Questionnaire C30 improved over time. This preplanned FU analysis of the largest 
      anti-programmed death protein 1 HL first-line trial to date confirms the 
      outstanding efficacy and relatively favorable safety profile of this therapeutic 
      approach.

TI  - Longer versus Shorter Schedules of Vincristine, Irinotecan, and Temozolomide 
      (VIT) for Relapsed or Refractory Ewing Sarcoma: A Randomized Controlled Phase 2 
      Trial.
PG  - 1040-1046

AB  - PURPOSE: The optimal dose schedule of vincristine, irinotecan, and temozolomide 
      (VIT) in relapsed or refractory patients with Ewing sarcoma requires 
      clarification. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing 
      sarcoma were randomly assigned (1:1) to either a shorter d × 5 schedule 
      (irinotecan 50 mg/m2/d D1-5, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 D1) or protracted d × 5×2 
      schedule (irinotecan 20 mg/m2/d D1-5,8-12, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 D1,8) together 
      with temozolomide (100 mg/m2/d D1-5). Patients were treated every 3 weeks for up 
      to eight cycles until progression or unacceptable toxic effects occurred. The 
      primary endpoint was objective response rate at 12 weeks (ORR12w). Secondary 
      endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and 
      safety. RESULT: A total of 46 patients presenting with relapsed or refractory 
      Ewing sarcoma were randomly assigned to the d × 5 (n = 24) or d × 5×2 (n = 22) 
      schedules. Median follow-up was 10.7 months in the d × 5 group and 8.3 months in 
      the d × 5×2 group. ORR12w was lower for d × 5 (5/24; 20.8%) patients than for d × 
      5×2 (12/22; 54.5%; P = 0.019), but no significant difference was found in PFS 
      (median PFS, 2.3 months for d × 5 vs. 4.3 months for d × 5×2) or OS (median OS, 
      14.8 months for d × 5 and 12.8 months for d × 5×2). Patients receiving the d × 5 
      schedule reported more grade 3 and 4 adverse events (AE) than those receiving d × 
      5×2, including diarrhea/abdominal pain and vomiting/nausea. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      protracted d × 5×2 VIT schedule showed superior efficacy and favorable 
      tolerability compared with the shorter d × 5 VIT schedule in patients with 
      relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma.

TI  - Adjuvant Temozolomide Chemotherapy With or Without Interferon Alfa Among Patients 
      With Newly Diagnosed High-grade Gliomas: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - e2253285
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.53285 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: High-grade gliomas (HGGs) constitute the most common and aggressive 
      primary brain tumor, with 5-year survival rates of 30.9% for grade 3 gliomas and 
      6.6% for grade 4 gliomas. The add-on efficacy of interferon alfa is unclear for 
      the treatment of HGG. OBJECTIVES: To compare the therapeutic efficacy and toxic 
      effects of the combination of temozolomide and interferon alfa and temozolomide 
      alone in patients with newly diagnosed HGG. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: 
      This multicenter, randomized, phase 3 clinical trial enrolled 199 patients with 
      newly diagnosed HGG from May 1, 2012, to March 30, 2016, at 15 Chinese medical 
      centers. Follow-up was completed July 31, 2021, and data were analyzed from 
      September 13 to November 24, 2021. Eligible patients were aged 18 to 75 years 
      with newly diagnosed and histologically confirmed HGG and had received no prior 
      chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy for their HGG. INTERVENTIONS: All 
      patients received standard radiotherapy concurrent with temozolomide. After a 
      4-week break, patients in the temozolomide with interferon alfa group received 
      standard temozolomide combined with interferon alfa every 28 days. Patients in 
      the temozolomide group received standard temozolomide. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: The primary end point was 2-year overall survival (OS). Secondary end 
      points were 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) and treatment tolerability. 
      RESULTS: A total of 199 patients with HGG were enrolled, with a median follow-up 
      time of 66.0 (95% CI, 59.1-72.9) months. Seventy-nine patients (39.7%) were women 
      and 120 (60.3%) were men, with ages ranging from 18 to 75 years and a median age 
      of 46.9 (95% CI, 45.3-48.7) years. The median OS of patients in the temozolomide 
      plus interferon alfa group (26.7 [95% CI, 21.6-31.7] months) was significantly 
      longer than that in the standard group (18.8 [95% CI, 16.9-20.7] months; hazard 
      ratio [HR], 0.64 [95% CI, 0.47-0.88]; P = .005). Temozolomide plus interferon 
      alfa also significantly improved median OS in patients with O6-methylguanine-DNA 
      methyltransferase (MGMT) unmethylation (24.7 [95% CI, 20.5-28.8] months) compared 
      with temozolomide (17.4 [95% CI, 14.1-20.7] months; HR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.37-0.87]; 
      P = .008). Seizure and influenzalike symptoms were more common in the 
      temozolomide plus interferon alfa group, with 2 of 100 (2.0%) and 5 of 100 (5.0%) 
      patients with grades 1 and 2 toxic effects, respectively (P = .02). Finally, 
      results suggested that methylation level at the IFNAR1/2 promoter was a marker of 
      sensitivity to temozolomide plus interferon alfa. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      Compared with the standard regimen, temozolomide plus interferon alfa treatment 
      could prolong the survival time of patients with HGG, especially the MGMT 
      promoter unmethylation variant, and the toxic effects remained tolerable. TRIAL

TI  - Effect of Vocimagene Amiretrorepvec in Combination With Flucytosine vs Standard 
      of Care on Survival Following Tumor Resection in Patients With Recurrent 
      High-Grade Glioma: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 1939-1946

AB  - IMPORTANCE: New treatments are needed to improve the prognosis of patients with 
      recurrent high-grade glioma. OBJECTIVE: To compare overall survival for patients 
      receiving tumor resection followed by vocimagene amiretrorepvec (Toca 511) with 
      flucytosine (Toca FC) vs standard of care (SOC). DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: A randomized, open-label phase 2/3 trial (TOCA 5) in 58 centers in 
      the US, Canada, Israel, and South Korea, comparing posttumor resection treatment 
      with Toca 511 followed by Toca FC vs a defined single choice of approved (SOC) 
      therapies was conducted from November 30, 2015, to December 20, 2019. Patients 
      received tumor resection for first or second recurrence of glioblastoma or 
      anaplastic astrocytoma. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive 
      Toca 511/FC (n = 201) or SOC control (n = 202). For the Toca 511/FC group, 
      patients received Toca 511 injected into the resection cavity wall at the time of 
      surgery, followed by cycles of oral Toca FC 6 weeks after surgery. For the SOC 
      control group, patients received investigators' choice of single therapy: 
      lomustine, temozolomide, or bevacizumab. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary 
      outcome was overall survival (OS) in time from randomization date to death due to 
      any cause. Secondary outcomes reported in this study included safety, durable 
      response rate (DRR), duration of DRR, durable clinical benefit rate, OS and DRR 
      by IDH1 variant status, and 12-month OS. RESULTS: All 403 randomized patients 
      (median [SD] age: 56 [11.46] years; 62.5% [252] men) were included in the 
      efficacy analysis, and 400 patients were included in the safety analysis (3 
      patients on the SOC group did not receive resection). Final analysis included 271 
      deaths (141 deaths in the Toca 511/FC group and 130 deaths in the SOC control 
      group). The median follow-up was 22.8 months. The median OS was 11.10 months for 
      the Toca 511/FC group and 12.22 months for the control group (hazard ratio, 1.06; 
      95% CI 0.83, 1.35; P = .62). The secondary end points did not demonstrate 
      statistically significant differences. The rates of adverse events were similar 
      in the Toca 511/FC group and the SOC control group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      Among patients who underwent tumor resection for first or second recurrence of 
      glioblastoma or anaplastic astrocytoma, administration of Toca 511 and Toca FC, 
      compared with SOC, did not improve overall survival or other efficacy end points.

TI  - Improvement of functional outcome for patients with newly diagnosed grade 2 or 3 
      gliomas with co-deletion of 1p/19q - IMPROVE CODEL: the NOA-18 trial.
PG  - 645
LID - 10.1186/s12885-022-09720-z [doi]
LID - 645
AB  - BACKGROUND: Given the young age of patients with CNS WHO grade 2 and 3 
      oligodendrogliomas and the relevant risk of neurocognitive, functional, and 
      quality-of-life impairment with the current aggressive standard of care 
      treatment, chemoradiation with PCV, of the tumour located in the brain optimizing 
      care is the major challenge. METHODS: NOA-18 aims at improving qualified overall 
      survival (qOS) for adult patients with CNS WHO grade 2 and 3 oligodendrogliomas 
      by randomizing between standard chemoradiation with up to six six-weekly cycles 
      with PCV and six six-weekly cycles with lomustine and temozolomide (CETEG) 
      (n = 182 patients per group accrued over 4 years) thereby delaying radiotherapy 
      and adding the chemoradiotherapy concept at progression after initial 
      radiation-free chemotherapy, allowing for effective salvage treatment and 
      delaying potentially deleterious side effects. QOS represents a new concept and 
      is defined as OS without functional and/or cognitive and/or quality of life 
      deterioration regardless of whether tumour progression or toxicity is the main 
      cause. The primary objective is to show superiority of an initial CETEG treatment 
      followed by partial brain radiotherapy (RT) plus PCV (RT-PCV) at progression over 
      partial brain radiotherapy (RT) followed by procarbazine, lomustine, and 
      vincristine (PCV) chemotherapy (RT-PCV) and best investigators choice (BIC) at 
      progression for sustained qOS. An event concerning a sustained qOS is then 
      defined as a functional and/or cognitive and/or quality of life deterioration 
      after completion of primary therapy on two consecutive study visits with an 
      interval of 3 months, tolerating a deviation of at most 1 month. Assessments are 
      done with a 3-monthly MRI, assessment of the NANO scale, HRQoL, and KPS, and 
      annual cognitive testing. Secondary objectives are evaluation and comparison of 
      the two groups regarding secondary endpoints (short-term qOS, PFS, OS, complete 
      and partial response rate). The trial is planned to be conducted at a minimum of 
      18 NOA study sites in Germany. DISCUSSION: qOS represents a new concept. The 
      present NOA trial aims at showing the superiority of CETEG plus RT-PCV over 
      RT-PCV plus BIC as determined at the level of OS without sustained functional 
      deterioration for all patients with oligodendroglioma diagnosed according to the 
      most recent WHO classification. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov

      strategy after two cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, 
      vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (BEACOPP) provides similar 
      progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) and reduces early 
      toxicity compared with a nonmonitored standard treatment. Here, we report, with a 
      prolonged follow-up, the final study results. METHODS: Patients with advanced 
      Hodgkin lymphoma (stage III, IV, or IIB with mediastinum/thorax ratio > 0.33 or 
      extranodal involvement) age 16-60 years were prospectively randomly assigned 
      between 6 × BEACOPP and a PET-driven arm after 2 × BEACOPP delivering 4 × ABVD 
      (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) in PET2- and 4 × BEACOPP 
      in PET2+ patients. PET performed after four cycles of chemotherapy had to be 
      negative to complete the planned treatment. RESULTS: In total, 823 patients were 
      enrolled including 413 in the standard arm and 410 in the PET-driven arm. With a 
      67.2-month median follow-up, 5-year PFS (87.5% v 86.7%; hazard ratio [HR] = 1.07; 
      95% CI, 0.74 to 1.57; P = .67) and OS (97.7% in both arms; HR = 1.012; 95% CI, 
      0.50 to 2.10; P = .53) were similar in both randomization arms. In the whole 
      cohort, full interim PET assessment predicted patients' 5-year PFS (92.3% in 
      PET2-/PET4-, 75.4% [HR = 3.26; 95% CI, 18.3 to 5.77] in PET2+/PET4- and 46.5% [HR 
      = 12.4; 95% CI, 7.31 to 19.51] in PET4+ patients, respectively; P < .0001) 
      independent of international prognosis score. Five-year OS was also affected by 
      interim PET results, and PET2+/PET4- patients (93.5%; HR = 3.3; 95% CI, 1.07 to 
      10.1; P = .036) and PET4+ patients (91.9%; HR = 3.756; 95% CI, 1.07 to 13.18; P = 
      .038) had a significant lower OS than PET2-/PET4- patients (98.2%). Twenty-two 
      patients (2.7%) developed a second primary malignancy, 13 (3.2%) and 9 (2.2%) in 
      the standard and experimental arms, respectively. CONCLUSION: The extended 
      follow-up confirms the continued efficacy and favorable safety of AHL2011 
      PET-driven strategy, which is noninferior to standard six cycles of BEACOPP. PET4 
      provides additional prognostic information to PET2 and allows identifying 
      patients with particularly poor prognosis.

TI  - Proton therapy reduces the likelihood of high-grade radiation-induced lymphopenia 
      in glioblastoma patients: phase II randomized study of protons vs photons.
PG  - 284-294
LID - 10.1093/neuonc/noaa182 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated differences in radiation-induced grade 3+ lymphopenia 
      (G3+L), defined as an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) nadir of <500 cells/µL, 
      after proton therapy (PT) or X-ray (photon) therapy (XRT) for patients with 
      glioblastoma (GBM). METHODS: Patients enrolled in a randomized phase II trial 
      received PT (n = 28) or XRT (n = 56) concomitantly with temozolomide. ALC was 
      measured before, weekly during, and within 1 month after radiotherapy. 
      Whole-brain mean dose (WBMD) and brain dose-volume indices were extracted from 
      planned dose distributions. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression 
      analyses were used to identify independent predictive variables. The resulting 
      model was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. 
      RESULTS: Rates of G3+L were lower in men (7/47 [15%]) versus women (19/37 [51%]) 
      (P < 0.001), and for PT (4/28 [14%]) versus XRT (22/56 [39%]) (P = 0.024). G3+L 
      was significantly associated with baseline ALC, WBMD, and brain volumes receiving 
      5‒40 Gy(relative biological effectiveness [RBE]) or higher (ie, V5 through V40). 
      Stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis identified being female (odds 
      ratio [OR] 6.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.95‒22.4, P = 0.003), baseline ALC 
      (OR 0.18, 95% CI: 0.05‒0.51, P = 0.003), and whole-brain V20 (OR 1.07, 95% CI: 
      1.03‒1.13, P = 0.002) as the strongest predictors. ROC analysis yielded an area 
      under the curve of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.79-0.94) for the final G3+L prediction model. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Sex, baseline ALC, and whole-brain V20 were the strongest predictors 
      of G3+L for patients with GBM treated with radiation and temozolomide. PT reduced 
      brain volumes receiving low and intermediate doses and, consequently, reduced 
      G3+L.

TI  - A phase II randomized, multicenter, open-label trial of continuing adjuvant 
      temozolomide beyond 6 cycles in patients with glioblastoma (GEINO 14-01).
PG  - 1851-1861
LID - 10.1093/neuonc/noaa107 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Standard treatment for glioblastoma is radiation with concomitant and 
      adjuvant temozolomide for 6 cycles, although the optimal number of cycles of 
      adjuvant temozolomide has long been a subject of debate. We performed a phase II 
      randomized trial investigating whether extending adjuvant temozolomide for more 
      than 6 cycles improved outcome. METHODS: Glioblastoma patients treated at 20 
      Spanish hospitals who had not progressed after 6 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide 
      were centrally randomized to stop (control arm) or continue (experimental arm) 
      temozolomide up to a total of 12 cycles at the same doses they were receiving in 
      cycle 6. Patients were stratified by MGMT methylation and measurable disease. The 
      primary endpoint was differences in 6-month progression-free survival (PFS). 
      Secondary endpoints were PFS, overall survival (OS), and safety 
      (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02209948). RESULTS: From August 2014 to November 2018, 166 
      patients were screened, 7 of whom were ineligible. Seventy-nine patients were 
      included in the stop arm and 80 in the experimental arm. All patients were 
      included in the analyses of outcomes and of safety. There were no differences in 
      6-month PFS (control 55.7%; experimental 61.3%), PFS, or OS between arms. MGMT 
      methylation and absence of measurable disease were independent factors of better 
      outcome. Patients in the experimental arm had more lymphopenia (P < 0.001), 
      thrombocytopenia (P < 0.001), and nausea and vomiting (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Continuing temozolomide after 6 adjuvant cycles is associated with greater 
      toxicity but confers no additional benefit in 6-month PFS. KEY POINTS: 
      1. Extending adjuvant temozolomide to 12 cycles did not improve 6-month 
      PFS.2. Extending adjuvant temozolomide did not improve PFS or OS in any patient 
      subset.3. Extending adjuvant temozolomide was linked to increased toxicities.

TI  - Long-term outcomes in patients with BRAF V600-mutant metastatic melanoma 
      receiving dabrafenib monotherapy: Analysis from phase 2 and 3 clinical trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous analyses of BREAK-2 and BREAK-3 showed that durable outcomes 
      lasting ≥3 years are achievable with dabrafenib in some patients with BRAF 
      V600-mutant metastatic melanoma (MM); however, additional follow-up is needed to 
      fully characterise the long-term impact of dabrafenib in these patients. METHODS: 
      BREAK-2 was a single-arm phase 2 study evaluating dabrafenib in treatment-naive 
      or previously treated BRAF V600E/K-mutant MM. BREAK-3, a randomised (3:1) phase 3 
      study, assessed dabrafenib versus dacarbazine in previously untreated 
      unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600E-mutant melanoma. Five-year analyses were 
      performed. RESULTS: All BREAK-2 patients (N = 92 [V600E, n = 76; V600K, n = 16]) 
      discontinued treatment by the data cutoff. Median follow-up was 13.0 months. In 
      BRAF V600E patients, 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival 
      (OS) were 11% and 20%, respectively. Subsequent immunotherapy was received by 22% 
      of patients. In BREAK-3, median follow-up was 17.0 and 12.0 months in the 
      dabrafenib (n = 187) and dacarbazine (n = 63) arms, respectively. Thirty-seven 
      patients (59%) receiving dacarbazine crossed over to dabrafenib following disease 
      progression as per protocol. Five-year PFS was 12% in the dabrafenib arm; all 
      dacarbazine-arm patients progressed or were censored by 5 years. Dabrafenib 
      improved PFS versus dacarbazine, regardless of baseline lactate dehydrogenase 
      levels. Five-year OS rates were 24% and 22% in the dabrafenib and dacarbazine 
      arms, respectively. Subsequent therapy in each arm included anti-CTLA-4 
      (dabrafenib [24%] and dacarbazine [24%]) and/or anti-PD-1 (8% and 2%) treatment. 
      No new safety signals were observed. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These data, 
      representing extended follow-up for dabrafenib monotherapy, demonstrate that 
      durable benefit lasting ≥5 years is achievable in a subset of patients. TRIAL

TI  - Phase I/II trial of meclofenamate in progressive MGMT-methylated glioblastoma 
      under temozolomide second-line therapy-the MecMeth/NOA-24 trial.
PG  - 57
LID - 10.1186/s13063-021-05977-0 [doi]
LID - 57
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma is the most frequent and malignant primary brain tumor. 
      Even in the subgroup with O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter 
      methylation and favorable response to first-line therapy, survival after relapse 
      is short (12 months). Standard therapy for recurrent MGMT-methylated glioblastoma 
      is not standardized and may consist of re-resection, re-irradiation, and 
      chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ), lomustine (CCNU), or a combination thereof. 
      Preclinical results show that meclofenamate (MFA), originally developed as a 
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and registered in the USA, sensitizes 
      glioblastoma cells to temozolomide-induced toxicity via inhibition of gap 
      junction-mediated intercellular cytosolic traffic and demolishment of tumor 
      microtube (TM)-based network morphology. METHODS: In this study, combined MFA/TMZ 
      therapy will be administered (orally) in patients with first relapse of 
      MGMT-methylated glioblastoma. A phase I component (6-12 patients, 2 dose levels 
      of MFA + standard dose TMZ) evaluates safety and feasibility and determines the 
      dose for the randomized phase II component (2 × 30 patients) with 
      progression-free survival as the primary endpoint. DISCUSSION: This study is set 
      up to assess toxicity and first indications of efficacy of MFA repurposed in the 
      setting of a very difficult-to-treat recurrent tumor. The trial is a logical next 
      step after the identification of the role of resistance-providing TMs in 
      glioblastoma, and results will be crucial for further trials targeting TMs. In 
      case of favorable results, MFA may constitute the first clinically feasible 
      TM-targeted drug and therefore might bridge the idea of a TM-targeted therapeutic 
      approach from basic insights into clinical reality. TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT

TI  - A phase 1b randomised, placebo-controlled trial of nabiximols cannabinoid 
      oromucosal spray with temozolomide in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.
PG  - 1379-1387
LID - 10.1038/s41416-021-01259-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preclinical data suggest some cannabinoids may exert antitumour 
      effects against glioblastoma (GBM). Safety and preliminary efficacy of nabiximols 
      oromucosal cannabinoid spray plus dose-intense temozolomide (DIT) was evaluated 
      in patients with first recurrence of GBM. METHODS: Part 1 was open-label and Part 
      2 was randomised, double-blind, and placebo-controlled. Both required 
      individualised dose escalation. Patients received nabiximols (Part 1, n = 6; Part 
      2, n = 12) or placebo (Part 2 only, n = 9); maximum of 12 sprays/day with DIT for 
      up to 12 months. Safety, efficacy, and temozolomide (TMZ) pharmacokinetics (PK) 
      were monitored. RESULTS: The most common treatment-emergent adverse events 
      (TEAEs; both parts) were vomiting, dizziness, fatigue, nausea and headache. Most 
      patients experienced TEAEs that were grade 2 or 3 (CTCAE). In Part 2, 33% of both 
      nabiximols- and placebo-treated patients were progression-free at 6 months. 
      Survival at 1 year was 83% for nabiximols- and 44% for placebo-treated patients 
      (p = 0.042), although two patients died within the first 40 days of enrolment in 
      the placebo arm. There were no apparent effects of nabiximols on TMZ PK. 
      CONCLUSIONS: With personalised dosing, nabiximols had acceptable safety and 
      tolerability with no drug-drug interaction identified. The observed survival 
      differences support further exploration in an adequately powered randomised 
      controlled trial. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: Part 1- 
      NCT01812603; Part 2- NCT01812616.

TI  - Determinants of ovarian function after response-adapted therapy in patients with 
      advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma (RATHL): a secondary analysis of a randomised phase 3 
      trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adverse effects on reproductive function are a key concern in young 
      women treated with chemotherapy for advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma. We aimed to 
      identify risk factors for the extent of ovarian damage in women with Hodgkin's 
      lymphoma treated with different chemotherapy regimens to inform accurate advice 
      on options for fertility preservation. METHODS: We recruited female participants 
      from the randomised phase 3 RATHL trial, aged 18-45 years, based on availability 
      of participants at recruiting sites in the UK. The RATHL trial key inclusion 
      criteria were histologically confirmed classic Hodgkin's lymphoma, stage IIB-IV 
      or IIA with adverse features (bulky disease or more than two sites of 
      involvement), no previous treatments, and a performance status of 0-3. As part of 
      RATHL, participants were treated with two cycles of doxorubicin, bleomycin, 
      vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) or AVD followed by an interim PET-CT scan. 
      Participants who had negative interim scans (PET score of 1 to 3 according to the 
      Lugano classification) were randomly assigned (1:1) by use of minimisation, 
      stratified by interim PET score and study centre, to continue ABVD or AVD for 
      four more cycles. Participants with positive scans (PET score of 4 or 5) were 
      escalated to treatment with bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, 
      vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisolone (BEACOPP-14 or escalated BEACOPP) for 
      four cycles. For the protocol-driven prospective cohort substudy, ovarian 
      function was assessed before treatment, during chemotherapy, and then annually 
      for 3 years by use of serum antimüllerian hormone and follicle-stimulating 
      hormone measurements. The RATHL study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
      number NCT00678327. FINDINGS: Between Dec 13, 2010, and Dec 19, 2012, 67 eligible 
      participants were recruited for this prospective cohort study; 57 had received 
      ABVD or AVD (ABVD-AVD group) and ten BEACOPP-14 or escalated BEACOPP (BEACOPP 
      group). Follow-up was fixed at 3 years. Antimüllerian hormone concentrations 
      decreased during both chemotherapy regimens. At 1 year after chemotherapy, 
      antimüllerian hormone concentrations recovered to a median of 10·5 pmol/L (IQR 
      4·3-17·3) in the ABVD-AVD group, but little recovery was seen after BEACOPP 
      (median 0·11 pmol/L [0·07-0·20]). Age also affected the extent of ovarian 
      function recovery, with antimüllerian hormone recovery in participants aged 35 
      years or older in the ABVD-AVD group to 37% (SD 10) of their before treatment 
      concentrations, compared with full recovery to 127% (SD 12) in those younger than 
      35 years (p<0·0001). Follicle-stimulating hormone recovery to less than 25 IU/L 
      occurred for 95% of women younger than 35 years in the ABVD-AVD group by 2 years 
      and was also dependent on age (hazard ratio 0·49, 95% CI 0·37-0·65; p<0·0001). 
      INTERPRETATION: Reduced recovery of ovarian function observed in women older than 
      35 years treated with ABVD or AVD compared with younger women indicates that 
      treatment could reduce their reproductive lifespan and supports discussion of 
      fertility preservation before treatment. Women treated with BEACOPP should be 
      informed of its potential high gonadotoxicity. These findings warrant further 
      investigation in large, prospective studies with fertility and reproductive 
      lifespan as outcomes. FUNDING: Medical Research Foundation and Cancer Research

TI  - Outcome of Patients With Early-Stage Infradiaphragmatic Hodgkin Lymphoma: A 
      Comprehensive Analysis From the German Hodgkin Study Group.
PG  - 2603-2611
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2018.78.7192 [doi]
AB  - Purpose The prognostic effect of isolated infradiaphragmatic involvement in 
      Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is controversial, and there are little data about patients 
      treated with current therapies. Therefore, we performed a risk factor analysis to 
      focus on isolated nodal infradiaphragmatic disease in patients treated within the 
      German Hodgkin Study Group trials HD13 (clinical trial information: 
      ISRCTN63474366) and HD14 (clinical trial information: ISRCTN04761296) for 
      early-stage HL. Patients and Methods Characteristics and outcomes of patients who 
      had infradiaphragmatic HL were compared with patients who had supradiaphragmatic 
      disease. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated 
      according to Kaplan-Meier methods and were compared between groups using the 
      log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards regression, which was also applied for 
      multivariable analyses that adjusted for relevant baseline characteristics. 
      Results Of 2,903 qualified patients, 223 (7.7%) were diagnosed with isolated 
      nodal infradiaphragmatic disease. In general, these patients were older, had a 
      poorer performance status, were more often male, and had the nodular sclerosis 
      subtype less often than those with supradiaphragmatic disease. After a median 
      follow-up time of 51 months, PFS and OS were significantly worse in patients with 
      infradiaphragmatic disease (5-year PFS and OS, 80.1% and 91.5% v 91.2% and 97.6% 
      in patients with supradiaphragmatic disease; each P < .001). In multivariable 
      analyses, infradiaphragmatic HL remained a significant risk factor in terms of 
      PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.5; 95% CI, 1.04 to 2.2; P = .03) and OS (HR, 2.0; 95% 
      CI, 1.2 to 3.5; P = .01). However, inferior PFS and OS could not be observed 
      among those patients treated with the more intensive chemotherapy (two cycles of 
      doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine [ABVD] in HD13, and two 
      cycles of escalated bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, 
      vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone [BEACOPP(escalated)] plus two cycles of 
      ABVD in HD14; all patients received 30 Gy of involved-field radiotherapy). 
      Conclusion Early-stage HL that presents with infradiaphragmatic disease only 
      represents a distinct patient group with an inferior outcome. However, this 
      adverse outcome can be outweighed by appropriate combined modality treatment.

AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of adding temozolomide (TMZ) to 
      preoperative capecitabine (CAP)-based chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally 
      advanced rectal cancer (LARC) and validate O(6)-methylguanine DNA 
      methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation status as a predictive marker for TMZ 
      combined regimens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: LARC patients with clinical stage II 
      (cT3-4N0) or III (cT(any)N+) disease were enrolled. They were stratified into 
      unmethylated MGMT (uMGMT) and methylated MGMT (mMGMT) groups by 
      methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction before randomisation and were then 
      randomly assigned (1:1) to one of four treatment arms: uMGMT/CAP (arm A), 
      uMGMT/TMZ + CAP (arm B), mMGMT/CAP (arm C) and mMGMT/TMZ + CAP (arm D). The 
      primary end point was the pathological complete response (pCR) rate. RESULTS: 
      Between November 2017 and July 2020, 64 patients were randomised. Slow accrual 
      caused early study termination. After excluding four ineligible patients, 60 were 
      included in the full analysis set. The pCR rate was 15.0% (9/60), 0%, 14.3%, 
      18.8% and 26.7% for the entire cohort, arms A, B, C and D, respectively (P = 
      0.0498 between arms A and D). The pCR rate was 9.7% in the CAP group (arms A + 
      C), 20.7% in the TMZ + CAP group (arms B + D), 6.9% in the uMGMT group (arms A + 
      B) and 22.6% in the mMGMT group (arms C + D). Grade 1-2 nausea or vomiting was 
      significantly more frequent in the TMZ + CAP treatment groups (arms B + D) than 
      in the CAP treatment groups (arms A + C, P < 0.001) with no difference in grade 3 
      adverse events. There were no grade 4 or 5 adverse events. CONCLUSION: The 
      addition of TMZ to CAP-based chemoradiotherapy tended to improve pCR rates, 
      particularly in those with mMGMT LARC. MGMT status may warrant further 
      investigation as a predictive biomarker for chemotherapeutic agents and 
      radiotherapy.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate safety and efficacy outcomes for subjects on the ECHELON-1 
      study treated in North America (NA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: ECHELON-1 is a global, 
      open-label, randomized phase III study comparing doxorubicin, vinblastine, and 
      dacarbazine in combination with brentuximab vedotin (A+AVD) versus ABVD (AVD + 
      bleomycin) as first-line therapy in subjects with stage III or IV classical 
      Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL; NCT01712490). Subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive 
      A+AVD or ABVD intravenously on days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle for up to 6 
      cycles. RESULTS: The NA subgroup consisted of 497 subjects in the A+AVD (n = 250) 
      and ABVD (n = 247) arms. Similar to the primary analysis based on the 
      intent-to-treat population, the primary endpoint [modified progression-free 
      survival (PFS) per independent review] demonstrated an improvement among subjects 
      who received A+AVD compared with ABVD (HR = 0.60; P = 0.012). For PFS, the risk 
      of progression or death was also reduced (HR = 0.50; P = 0.002). Subsequent 
      anticancer therapies were lower in the A+AVD arm. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events 
      (AEs) were more common, but there were fewer study discontinuations due to AEs in 
      the A+AVD arm as compared with ABVD. Noted differences between arms included 
      higher rates of febrile neutropenia (20% vs. 9%) and peripheral neuropathy (80% 
      vs. 56%), but lower rates of pulmonary toxicity (3% vs. 10%) in subjects treated 
      with A+AVD versus ABVD. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy benefit and manageable toxicity 
      profile observed in the NA subgroup of ECHELON-1 support A+AVD as a frontline 
      treatment option for patients with stage III or IV cHL.

TI  - Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor enhances efficacy of nimustine 
      rendezvousing with temozolomide plus irradiation in patients with glioblastoma.
PG  - 635-645
LID - 10.3233/THC-220194 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma is the most common and most aggressive type of primary 
      brain tumor. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and 
      safety of intranasal granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) 
      administration combined with chemoradiotherapy in patients with glioblastoma who 
      underwent surgery. METHODS: Ninety-two patients were randomly divided into two 
      groups: a control group (n= 46), who received radiotherapy with adjuvant local 
      delivery of nimustine hydrochloride (ACNU) and systemic administration of 
      temozolomide, and an intervention group (n= 46), who received intranasal GM-CSF 
      prior to each cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy in addition to the treatment of the 
      control group. Karnofsky performance status (KPS) scores, progression-free 
      survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse effects were calculated and 
      compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the 
      intervention group had longer PFS (7.8 vs. 6.9 months, P= 0.016) and OS (19.2 vs. 
      17.1 months, P= 0.045, without adjustment for interim analyses). The KPS scores 
      were also higher in the intervention group than in the control group after 6 
      months (84.35 ± 8.86 vs. 80.65 ± 7.72; t= 4.552, P= 0.036). Furthermore, the 
      patients in the intervention group had lower incidence of neutropenia and 
      thrombocytopenia (8.7% vs. 29.5%, P= 0.012; 8.7% vs. 18.2%, P= 0.186). Other 
      adverse events were similar in both groups, and most adverse events were grade 
      I/II and resolved spontaneously. CONCLUSION: Intranasal GM-CSF enhances the 
      efficacy of the local ACNU administration combined with oral temozolomide 
      chemotherapy. The survival and performance status were significantly improved in 
      patients with glioblastoma after surgery. Additionally, the GM-CSF therapy was 
      able to reduce the occurrence of chemotherapy-related neutropenia and 
      thrombocytopenia.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of brentuximab vedotin plus chemotherapy as frontline 
      treatment of stage III or IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma.
PG  - 117-130
LID - 10.1080/13696998.2018.1542599 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The ECHELON-1 trial demonstrated efficacy and safety of brentuximab 
      vedotin plus doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (A + AVD) vs doxorubicin, 
      bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) as frontline therapy for stage 
      III/IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma. This analysis evaluated the cost-effectiveness 
      of A + AVD from a US healthcare payer perspective. METHODS: The incremental 
      cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), defined as the incremental costs per 
      quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, was estimated using a non-homogenous 
      semi-Markov cohort model with health states defined on progression following 
      frontline treatment, and for those with progression, receipt of autologous 
      stem-cell transplant (ASCT), and progression after ASCT. Patients undergoing ASCT 
      were classified as refractory or relapsed based on timing of progression. 
      Probabilities of progression/death with frontline therapy were based on 
      parametric survival distributions fit to data on modified progression-free 
      survival (mPFS) from ECHELON-1. Duration of frontline treatment and incidence of 
      adverse events were from ECHELON-1. Utility values for patients in the frontline 
      mPFS state were based on EQ-5D data from ECHELON-1. Other inputs were from 
      published sources. A lifetime time horizon was used. Costs and QALYs were 
      discounted at 3%. Analyses were conducted alternately using data on mPFS for the 
      overall and North American populations of ECHELON-1. RESULTS: The ICER for 
      A + AVD vs ABVD was $172,074/QALY gained in the analysis using data on mPFS for 
      the overall population and $69,442/QALY gained in the analysis using data on mPFS 
      for the North American population of ECHELON-1. The ICER is sensitive to 
      estimated costs of ASCT and frontline failure. CONCLUSION: The ICER for A + AVD 
      vs ABVD based on ECHELON-1 is within the range of threshold values for 
      cost-effectiveness in the US. A + AVD is, therefore, likely to be a 
      cost-effective frontline therapy for patients with stage III/IV classical Hodgkin 
      lymphoma from a US healthcare payer perspective.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the EORTC 1410/INTELLANCE 2 randomised, phase II study 
      (NCT02343406), with the antibody-drug conjugate depatuxizumab mafodotin 
      (Depatux-M, ABT-414) in patients with recurrent EGFR-amplified glioblastoma, the 
      primary end-point (overall survival) was not met, and the drug had ocular 
      dose-limiting toxicity. This study reports results from the prespecified 
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and neurological deterioration-free 
      survival (NDFS) exploratory analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n = 260) 
      were randomised 1:1:1 to receive either Depatux-M 1.25 mg/kg or 1.0 mg/kg 
      intravenously every 2 weeks with oral temozolomide (TMZ) 150 mg/m(2), Depatux-M 
      alone, or TMZ or oral lomustine (CCNU) 110 mg/m(2) (TMZ/CCNU). HRQoL outcomes 
      were recorded using the EORTC core Quality of Life QLQ-C30, and brain 
      cancer-specific QLQ-BN20 questionnaires. Questionnaires were completed at 
      baseline, weeks 8 and 16, and month 6, and changes from baseline to each time 
      point were calculated. NDFS was defined as time to first deterioration in World 
      Health Organisation performance status. RESULTS: Compliance with HRQoL was 88.1% 
      at baseline and decreased to 37.9% at month 6. Differences from baseline between 
      Depatux-M arms and TMZ/CCNU in global health/QoL status throughout treatment did 
      not reach clinical relevance (≥10 points). Self-reported visual disorders 
      deteriorated to a clinically relevant extent with Depatux-M arms versus TMZ/CCNU 
      at all timepoints (mean differences range: 24.6-35.1 points). Changes from 
      baseline for other HRQoL scales and NDFS were generally similar between treatment 
      arms. CONCLUSIONS: Depatux-M had no impact on HRQoL and NDFS in patients with 
      EGFR-amplified recurrent glioblastoma, except for more visual disorders, an 
      expected side-effect of the study drug. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02343406.

TI  - JCOG0911 INTEGRA study: a randomized screening phase II trial of interferonβ plus 
      temozolomide in comparison with temozolomide alone for newly diagnosed 
      glioblastoma.
PG  - 627-636
LID - 10.1007/s11060-018-2831-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study explored the superiority of temozolomide (TMZ) + interferonβ 
      (IFNβ) to standard TMZ as treatment for newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) via 
      randomized phase II screening design. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Eligibility criteria 
      included histologically proven GBM, with 50% of the tumor located in 
      supratentorial areas, without involvement of the optic, olfactory nerves, and 
      pituitary gland and without multiple lesions and dissemination. Patients in the 
      TMZ + radiotherapy (RT) arm received RT (2.0 Gy/fr/day, 30 fr) with TMZ 
      (75 mg/m(2), daily) followed by TMZ maintenance (100-200 mg/m(2)/day, days 1-5, 
      every 4 weeks) for 2 years. Patients in the TMZ + IFNβ + RT arm intravenously 
      received IFNβ (3 MU/body, alternative days during RT and day 1, every 4 weeks 
      during maintenance period) and TMZ + RT. The primary endpoint was overall 
      survival (OS). The planned sample size was 120 (one-sided alpha 0.2; power 0.8). 
      RESULTS: Between Apr 2010 and Jan 2012, 122 patients were randomized. The median 
      OS with TMZ + RT and TMZ + IFNβ + RT was 20.3 and 24.0 months (HR 1.00, 95% CI 
      0.65-1.55; one-sided log rank P = 0.51). The median progression-free survival 
      times were 10.1 and 8.5 months (HR 1.25, 95% CI 0.85-1.84). The incidence of 
      neutropenia with the TMZ + RT and the TMZ + IFNβ + RT (grade 3-4, CTCAE version 
      3.0) was 12.7 versus 20.7% during concomitant period and was 3.6 versus 9.3% 
      during maintenance period. The incidence of lymphopenia was 54.0 versus 63.8% and 
      34.5 versus 41.9%. CONCLUSIONS: TMZ + IFNβ + RT is not considered as a candidate 
      for the following phase III trial, and TMZ + RT remained to be a most promising 
      treatment. This trial was registered with the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry: 
      UMIN000003466.

TI  - Randomized open-label phase II trial of 5-day aprepitant plus ondansetron 
      compared to ondansetron alone in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced 
      nausea-vomiting (CINV) in glioma patients receiving adjuvant temozolomide.
PG  - 2229-2238
LID - 10.1007/s00520-019-05039-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: CINV remains a distressing side effect experienced by glioma patients 
      receiving multi-day temozolomide therapy, in spite of guideline-based antiemetic 
      therapy with selective serotonin-receptor-antagonists. Antiemetic research with 
      aprepitant has routinely excluded glioma patients. In this randomized open-label 
      phase II study, use of a nonstandard 5-day regimen of aprepitant for glioma 
      patients was investigated. METHODS: One hundred thirty-six glioma patients 
      receiving their first cycle of adjuvant temozolomide (150-200 mg/m(2)/day × 
      5 days every 28 days) were randomized to Arm-A (ondansetron 8 mg days 1-5 with 
      aprepitant day 1: 125 mg, days 2-5: 80 mg) or Arm-B (ondansetron). Randomization 
      was stratified by tumor grade and number of prior chemotherapy regimens. The 
      primary endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving complete control (CC), 
      defined as no emetic episode or antiemetic rescue medication over the 7-day study 
      period. Secondary endpoints included CINV efficacy in the acute phase (≤ 24 h) 
      and delayed phase (days 2-7), as well as safety and quality of life (QoL). 
      RESULTS: Patients were 61% male, 97% white, 48% with KPS > 90%, 60% non-smokers, 
      mean age 54, 92% with low alcohol use, and 46% with a CINV history. The CC was 
      58.6% (Arm-A) and 54.5% (Arm-B). Acute-complete response (CR) rates, defined as 
      CC on day 1 in Arm-A and -B, were 97.1% and 87.9%, respectively (p = 0.056). 
      Treatment-related toxicities were mild or moderate in severity. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Aprepitant plus ondansetron may increase acute-CR, may have benefit regarding 
      CINV's effect on QoL, and is safe for 5-day temozolomide compared to ondansetron. 
      This study provides no evidence that aprepitant increases CC rate over 
      ondansetron alone.

TI  - Phase 1b/2a study of galunisertib, a small molecule inhibitor of transforming 
      growth factor-beta receptor I, in combination with standard temozolomide-based 
      radiochemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma.

AB  - Purpose Galunisertib, a TGF-β inhibitor, has demonstrated antitumor effects in 
      preclinical and radiographic responses in some patients with malignant glioma. 
      This Phase 1b/2a trial investigated the clinical benefit of combining 
      galunisertib with temozolomide-based radiochemotherapy (TMZ/RTX) in patients with 
      newly diagnosed malignant glioma (NCT01220271). Methods This is an open-label, 
      2-arm Phase 1b/2a study (N = 56) of galunisertib (intermittent dosing: 14 days 
      on/14 days off per cycle of 28 days) in combination with TMZ/RTX (n = 40), versus 
      a control arm (TMZ/RTX, n = 16). The primary objective of Phase 1b was to 
      determine the safe and tolerable Phase 2 dose of galunisertib. The primary 
      objective of Phase 2a was to confirm the tolerability and pharmacodynamic profile 
      of galunisertib with TMZ/RTX, and the secondary objectives included determining 
      the efficacy and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of galunisertib with TMZ/RTX in 
      patients with glioblastoma. This study also characterized the changes in the 
      major T-cell subsets during TMZ/RTX plus galunisertib treatment. Results In the 
      Phase 2a study, efficacy results for patients treated with galunisertib plus 
      TMZ/RTX or TMZ/RTX were: median overall survival (18.2 vs 17.9 months), median 
      progression-free survival (7.6 vs 11.5 months), and disease control rate (80% 
      [32/40] vs 56% [9/16] patients) respectively. PK profile of galunisertib plus 
      TMZ/RTX regimen was consistent with previously published PK data of galunisertib. 
      The overall safety profile across treatment arms was comparable. Conclusion No 
      differences in efficacy, safety or pharmacokinetic variables were observed 
      between the two treatment arms.

TI  - Health-related quality of life in early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma: a longitudinal 
      analysis of the ABVD arm in the randomized controlled trial HD.6.
PG  - 256
LID - 10.1007/s00520-023-07717-3 [doi]
AB  - Early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma has become one of the most curable hematologic 
      malignancies. Depending upon the disease location, possible toxicities, and 
      patient preference, chemotherapy alone with ABVD remains an accepted treatment 
      modality for this disease. There remains a paucity of data regarding the 
      longitudinal trajectory of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients 
      treated for HL. The impact of disease and treatment on HRQoL is increasingly 
      important to understand as the number of long-term survivors increases. We report 
      the longitudinal HRQoL using data prospectively collected from diagnosis up to 10 
      years post-treatment in the ABVD arm of the HD.6 randomized controlled trial for 
      early-stage HL patients (N=169). We analyzed HRQoL using the EORTC QLQ-C30 
      collected at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after completion of 
      chemotherapy and yearly up to year 10. Clinically and statistically significant 
      improvements were noted for specific domains including emotional (3 months 
      post-treatment), social (12 months post-treatment) and financial functioning (2 
      years post-treatment), and the specific symptom of fatigue (6 months 
      post-treatment) during the follow-up period. To our knowledge, this is the first 
      prospective, longitudinal analysis of HRQoL specifically among patients with 
      early-stage HL treated with ABVD therapy alone. Although improvements were noted, 
      sustained clinically and statistically significant improvements were noted only 
      in select symptoms emphasizing the need to better understand and optimize HRQoL 
      among this patient group.

TI  - Radiotherapy alone with concurrent chemoradiotherapy plus temozolamide in locally 
      advanced soft tissue sarcoma at Mayo Hospital Lahore: A randomized controlled 
      trial.
PG  - 572-576
LID - 10.5455/JPMA.293442 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of combining an oral chemotherapeutic agent 
      temozolamide with radiotherapy in the management of the un-resectable 
      non-metastatic soft tissue sarcomas compared with radiotherapy alone. METHODS: 
      The randomised controlled phase 3, double-arm study was conducted at King Edward 
      Medical University/Mayo Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan, from December 2012 to July 
      2017. Patients with all sub-types of locally advanced un-resectable soft tissue 
      sarcomas were randomised into two groups. Group-A received radiotherapy alone 
      while Group-B received concomitant chemoradiotherapy with temozolamide after 
      receiving two cycles of standard chemotherapy. Response was evaluated according 
      to response evaluation criteria in solid tumours through computed tomography scan 
      or magnetic resonance imaging after 6 weeks following completion of radiotherapy. 
      SPSS 21 was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Of the 64 patients, 32(50%) were 
      assigned to each group. The mean age of Group-A was 36.25±20.31 and of Group-B 
      37.84±15.79 years .There were 18(56.3%) males in Group-A and 20(62.5%) in 
      Group-B. Improvement in trends of overall response rate was observed in Group-B 
      24(75%) compared to 18(56.3%) in Group-A (p=0.12).. CONCLUSIONS: Though not 
      statistically significant, there was improvement in response rate with the 
      addition of temozolamide to standard radiation therapy.
