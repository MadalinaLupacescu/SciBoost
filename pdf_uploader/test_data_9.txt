TI  - Overall Survival with Brentuximab Vedotin in Stage III or IV Hodgkin's Lymphoma.
PG  - 310-320
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa2206125 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Five-year follow-up in a trial involving patients with previously 
      untreated stage III or IV classic Hodgkin's lymphoma showed long-term 
      progression-free survival benefits with first-line therapy with brentuximab 
      vedotin, a CD30-directed antibody-drug conjugate, plus doxorubicin, vinblastine, 
      and dacarbazine (A+AVD), as compared with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, 
      and dacarbazine (ABVD). A planned interim analysis indicated a potential benefit 
      with regard to overall survival; data from a median of 6 years of follow-up are 
      now available. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
      up to six cycles of A+AVD or ABVD. The primary end point, modified 
      progression-free survival, has been reported previously. The key secondary end 
      point was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was also 
      assessed. RESULTS: A total of 664 patients were assigned to receive A+AVD and 670 
      to receive ABVD. At a median follow-up of 73.0 months, 39 patients in the A+AVD 
      group and 64 in the ABVD group had died (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence 
      interval [CI], 0.40 to 0.88; P = 0.009). The 6-year overall survival estimates 
      were 93.9% (95% CI, 91.6 to 95.5) in the A+AVD group and 89.4% (95% CI, 86.6 to 
      91.7) in the ABVD group. Progression-free survival was longer with A+AVD than 
      with ABVD (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.53 to 
      0.86). Fewer patients in the A+AVD group than in the ABVD group received 
      subsequent therapy, including transplantation, and fewer second cancers were 
      reported with A+AVD (in 23 vs. 32 patients). Primary prophylaxis with granulocyte 
      colony-stimulating factor was recommended after an increased incidence of febrile 
      neutropenia was observed with A+AVD. More patients had peripheral neuropathy with 
      A+AVD than with ABVD, but most patients in the two groups had resolution or 
      amelioration of the event by the last follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who 
      received A+AVD for the treatment of stage III or IV Hodgkin's lymphoma had a 
      survival advantage over those who received ABVD. (Funded by Takeda Development

TI  - Brentuximab Vedotin Plus AVD for First-Line Treatment of Early-Stage Unfavorable 
      Hodgkin Lymphoma (BREACH): A Multicenter, Open-Label, Randomized, Phase II Trial.
PG  - 327-335
LID - 10.1200/JCO.21.01281 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The prognosis of patients with early-stage unfavorable Hodgkin lymphoma 
      remains unsatisfactory. We assessed the efficacy and safety of brentuximab 
      vedotin plus doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (BV-AVD) in previously 
      untreated, early-stage unfavorable Hodgkin lymphoma (ClinicalTrials.gov 
      identifier: NCT02292979). METHODS: BREACH is a multicenter, randomized, 
      open-label, phase II trial. Eligible patients were age 18-60 years with ≥ 1 
      unfavorable EORTC/LYSA criterion. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to four 
      cycles of BV-AVD or standard doxorubicin, bleomycin, vincristine, and dacarbazine 
      (ABVD), followed by 30 Gy involved node radiotherapy. The primary end point was 
      the positron emission tomography (PET) response rate after two cycles by expert 
      independent review using the Deauville score. The study was designed to test if 
      the PET-negative rate after two cycles of BV-AVD was superior to 75%. We 
      hypothesized a 10% increase in the PET-negative rate after two cycles of BV-AVD. 
      RESULTS: Between March 2015 and October 2016, 170 patients were enrolled. After 
      two cycles, the primary end point of the study was met: 93 (82.3%; 90% CI, 75.3 
      to 88.0) of 113 patients in the BV-AVD arm were PET-negative (Deauville score 
      1-3) compared with 43 (75.4%; 90% CI, 64.3% to 84.5%) of 57 in the ABVD arm. The 
      2-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 97.3% (95% CI, 91.9 to 99.1) and 92.6% 
      (95% CI, 81.4% to 97.2%) in the BV-AVD and ABVD arms, respectively. High total 
      metabolic tumor volume was associated with a significantly shorter PFS (hazard 
      ratio, 17.9; 95% CI, 2.2 to 145.5; P < .001). For patients with high total 
      metabolic tumor volume, the 2-year PFS rate was 90.9% (95% CI, 74.4 to 97.0) and 
      70.7% (95% CI, 39.4% to 87.9%) in the BV-AVD and ABVD arms, respectively. 
      CONCLUSION: BV-AVD demonstrated an improvement in the PET-negative rate compared 
      with ABVD after two cycles.

TI  - Patterns, predictors and prognostic relevance of high-grade hematotoxicity after 
      temozolomide or temozolomide-lomustine in the CeTeG/NOA-09 trial.
PG  - 147-153
LID - 10.1007/s11060-022-04203-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: In the randomized phase III trial CeTeG/NOA-09, temozolomide 
      (TMZ)/lomustine (CCNU) combination therapy was superior to TMZ in newly diagnosed 
      MGMT methylated glioblastoma, albeit reporting more frequent hematotoxicity. 
      Here, we analyze high grade hematotoxicity and its prognostic relevance in the 
      trial population. METHODS: Descriptive and comparative analysis of hematotoxicity 
      adverse events ≥ grade 3 (HAE) according to the Common Terminology of Clinical 
      Adverse Events, version 4.0 was performed. The association of HAE with survival 
      was assessed in a landmark analysis. Logistic regression analysis was performed 
      to predict HAE during the concomitant phase of chemotherapy. RESULTS: HAE 
      occurred in 36.4% and 28.6% of patients under CCNU/TMZ and TMZ treatment, 
      respectively. The median onset of the first HAE was during concomitant 
      chemotherapy (i.e. first CCNU/TMZ course or daily TMZ therapy), and 42.9% of 
      patients with HAE receiving further courses experienced repeat HAE. Median HAE 
      duration was similar between treatment arms (CCNU/TMZ 11.5; TMZ 13 days). 
      Chemotherapy was more often discontinued due to HAE in CCNU/TMZ than in TMZ (19.7 
      vs. 6.3%, p = 0.036). The occurrence of HAE was not associated with survival 
      differences (p = 0.76). Regression analysis confirmed older age (OR 1.08) and 
      female sex (OR 2.47), but not treatment arm, as predictors of HAE. CONCLUSION: 
      Older age and female sex are associated with higher incidence of HAE. Although 
      occurrence of HAE was not associated with shorter survival, reliable prediction 
      of patients at risk might be beneficial to allow optimal management of therapy 
      and allocation of supportive measures. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01149109.

TI  - Nivolumab and Doxorubicin, Vinblastine, and Dacarbazine in Early-Stage 
      Unfavorable Hodgkin Lymphoma: Final Analysis of the Randomized German Hodgkin 
      Study Group Phase II NIVAHL Trial.
PG  - 1193-1199

AB  - Clinical trials frequently include multiple end points that mature at different 
      times. The initial report, typically based on the primary end point, may be 
      published when key planned co-primary or secondary analyses are not yet 
      available. Clinical Trial Updates provide an opportunity to disseminate 
      additional results from studies, published in JCO or elsewhere, for which the 
      primary end point has already been reported.In the investigator-sponsored 
      randomized phase II NIVAHL trial for early-stage unfavorable classical Hodgkin 
      lymphoma (HL), two schedules of four cycles of nivolumab, doxorubicin, 
      vinblastine, and dacarbazine followed by 30 Gy involved-site radiotherapy 
      resulted in high complete remission rates and an unprecedented 1-year 
      progression-free survival in 109 patients. In this article, we report the 
      preplanned final analysis conducted three years after the registration of the 
      last patient including long-term safety results. No survival events were observed 
      since the primary analysis, and after a median follow-up (FU) of 41 months, the 
      overall survival was 100% in both treatment groups. The progression-free survival 
      was 98% and 100% in the sequential and concomitant nivolumab, doxorubicin, 
      vinblastine, and dacarbazine treatment groups, respectively. At last FU, the mean 
      forced expiratory pressure in one second was 95.5% (standard deviation 12.7%), 
      the mean diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide adjusted for hemoglobin was 82.8% 
      (standard deviation 15.4%), and the left ventricular ejection fraction was in the 
      normal range in 95% of patients. Hypothyroidism requiring long-term medication 
      occurred in 15% of patients, who were nearly exclusively female (87%). No second 
      primary malignancies occurred, and no patient required corticosteroid treatment 
      at last FU. Patient-reported normalized global quality-of-life score measured by 
      European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life 
      Questionnaire C30 improved over time. This preplanned FU analysis of the largest 
      anti-programmed death protein 1 HL first-line trial to date confirms the 
      outstanding efficacy and relatively favorable safety profile of this therapeutic 
      approach.

TI  - Longer versus Shorter Schedules of Vincristine, Irinotecan, and Temozolomide 
      (VIT) for Relapsed or Refractory Ewing Sarcoma: A Randomized Controlled Phase 2 
      Trial.

AB  - PURPOSE: The optimal dose schedule of vincristine, irinotecan, and temozolomide 
      (VIT) in relapsed or refractory patients with Ewing sarcoma requires 
      clarification. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing 
      sarcoma were randomly assigned (1:1) to either a shorter d × 5 schedule 
      (irinotecan 50 mg/m2/d D1-5, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 D1) or protracted d × 5×2 
      schedule (irinotecan 20 mg/m2/d D1-5,8-12, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 D1,8) together 
      with temozolomide (100 mg/m2/d D1-5). Patients were treated every 3 weeks for up 
      to eight cycles until progression or unacceptable toxic effects occurred. The 
      primary endpoint was objective response rate at 12 weeks (ORR12w). Secondary 
      endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and 
      safety. RESULT: A total of 46 patients presenting with relapsed or refractory 
      Ewing sarcoma were randomly assigned to the d × 5 (n = 24) or d × 5×2 (n = 22) 
      schedules. Median follow-up was 10.7 months in the d × 5 group and 8.3 months in 
      the d × 5×2 group. ORR12w was lower for d × 5 (5/24; 20.8%) patients than for d × 
      5×2 (12/22; 54.5%; P = 0.019), but no significant difference was found in PFS 
      (median PFS, 2.3 months for d × 5 vs. 4.3 months for d × 5×2) or OS (median OS, 
      14.8 months for d × 5 and 12.8 months for d × 5×2). Patients receiving the d × 5 
      schedule reported more grade 3 and 4 adverse events (AE) than those receiving d × 
      5×2, including diarrhea/abdominal pain and vomiting/nausea. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      protracted d × 5×2 VIT schedule showed superior efficacy and favorable 
      tolerability compared with the shorter d × 5 VIT schedule in patients with 
      relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma.

TI  - Adjuvant Temozolomide Chemotherapy With or Without Interferon Alfa Among Patients 
      With Newly Diagnosed High-grade Gliomas: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - e2253285
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.53285 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: High-grade gliomas (HGGs) constitute the most common and aggressive 
      primary brain tumor, with 5-year survival rates of 30.9% for grade 3 gliomas and 
      6.6% for grade 4 gliomas. The add-on efficacy of interferon alfa is unclear for 
      the treatment of HGG. OBJECTIVES: To compare the therapeutic efficacy and toxic 
      effects of the combination of temozolomide and interferon alfa and temozolomide 
      alone in patients with newly diagnosed HGG. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: 
      This multicenter, randomized, phase 3 clinical trial enrolled 199 patients with 
      newly diagnosed HGG from May 1, 2012, to March 30, 2016, at 15 Chinese medical 
      centers. Follow-up was completed July 31, 2021, and data were analyzed from 
      September 13 to November 24, 2021. Eligible patients were aged 18 to 75 years 
      with newly diagnosed and histologically confirmed HGG and had received no prior 
      chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy for their HGG. INTERVENTIONS: All 
      patients received standard radiotherapy concurrent with temozolomide. After a 
      4-week break, patients in the temozolomide with interferon alfa group received 
      standard temozolomide combined with interferon alfa every 28 days. Patients in 
      the temozolomide group received standard temozolomide. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: The primary end point was 2-year overall survival (OS). Secondary end 
      points were 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) and treatment tolerability. 
      RESULTS: A total of 199 patients with HGG were enrolled, with a median follow-up 
      time of 66.0 (95% CI, 59.1-72.9) months. Seventy-nine patients (39.7%) were women 
      and 120 (60.3%) were men, with ages ranging from 18 to 75 years and a median age 
      of 46.9 (95% CI, 45.3-48.7) years. The median OS of patients in the temozolomide 
      plus interferon alfa group (26.7 [95% CI, 21.6-31.7] months) was significantly 
      longer than that in the standard group (18.8 [95% CI, 16.9-20.7] months; hazard 
      ratio [HR], 0.64 [95% CI, 0.47-0.88]; P = .005). Temozolomide plus interferon 
      alfa also significantly improved median OS in patients with O6-methylguanine-DNA 
      methyltransferase (MGMT) unmethylation (24.7 [95% CI, 20.5-28.8] months) compared 
      with temozolomide (17.4 [95% CI, 14.1-20.7] months; HR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.37-0.87]; 
      P = .008). Seizure and influenzalike symptoms were more common in the 
      temozolomide plus interferon alfa group, with 2 of 100 (2.0%) and 5 of 100 (5.0%) 
      patients with grades 1 and 2 toxic effects, respectively (P = .02). Finally, 
      results suggested that methylation level at the IFNAR1/2 promoter was a marker of 
      sensitivity to temozolomide plus interferon alfa. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      Compared with the standard regimen, temozolomide plus interferon alfa treatment 
      could prolong the survival time of patients with HGG, especially the MGMT 
      promoter unmethylation variant, and the toxic effects remained tolerable. TRIAL

AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of adding temozolomide (TMZ) to 
      preoperative capecitabine (CAP)-based chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally 
      advanced rectal cancer (LARC) and validate O(6)-methylguanine DNA 
      methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation status as a predictive marker for TMZ 
      combined regimens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: LARC patients with clinical stage II 
      (cT3-4N0) or III (cT(any)N+) disease were enrolled. They were stratified into 
      unmethylated MGMT (uMGMT) and methylated MGMT (mMGMT) groups by 
      methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction before randomisation and were then 
      randomly assigned (1:1) to one of four treatment arms: uMGMT/CAP (arm A), 
      uMGMT/TMZ + CAP (arm B), mMGMT/CAP (arm C) and mMGMT/TMZ + CAP (arm D). The 
      primary end point was the pathological complete response (pCR) rate. RESULTS: 
      Between November 2017 and July 2020, 64 patients were randomised. Slow accrual 
      caused early study termination. After excluding four ineligible patients, 60 were 
      included in the full analysis set. The pCR rate was 15.0% (9/60), 0%, 14.3%, 
      18.8% and 26.7% for the entire cohort, arms A, B, C and D, respectively (P = 
      0.0498 between arms A and D). The pCR rate was 9.7% in the CAP group (arms A + 
      C), 20.7% in the TMZ + CAP group (arms B + D), 6.9% in the uMGMT group (arms A + 
      B) and 22.6% in the mMGMT group (arms C + D). Grade 1-2 nausea or vomiting was 
      significantly more frequent in the TMZ + CAP treatment groups (arms B + D) than 
      in the CAP treatment groups (arms A + C, P < 0.001) with no difference in grade 3 
      adverse events. There were no grade 4 or 5 adverse events. CONCLUSION: The 
      addition of TMZ to CAP-based chemoradiotherapy tended to improve pCR rates, 
      particularly in those with mMGMT LARC. MGMT status may warrant further 
      investigation as a predictive biomarker for chemotherapeutic agents and 
      radiotherapy.

TI  - Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor enhances efficacy of nimustine 
      rendezvousing with temozolomide plus irradiation in patients with glioblastoma.
PG  - 635-645
LID - 10.3233/THC-220194 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma is the most common and most aggressive type of primary 
      brain tumor. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and 
      safety of intranasal granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) 
      administration combined with chemoradiotherapy in patients with glioblastoma who 
      underwent surgery. METHODS: Ninety-two patients were randomly divided into two 
      groups: a control group (n= 46), who received radiotherapy with adjuvant local 
      delivery of nimustine hydrochloride (ACNU) and systemic administration of 
      temozolomide, and an intervention group (n= 46), who received intranasal GM-CSF 
      prior to each cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy in addition to the treatment of the 
      control group. Karnofsky performance status (KPS) scores, progression-free 
      survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse effects were calculated and 
      compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the 
      intervention group had longer PFS (7.8 vs. 6.9 months, P= 0.016) and OS (19.2 vs. 
      17.1 months, P= 0.045, without adjustment for interim analyses). The KPS scores 
      were also higher in the intervention group than in the control group after 6 
      months (84.35 ± 8.86 vs. 80.65 ± 7.72; t= 4.552, P= 0.036). Furthermore, the 
      patients in the intervention group had lower incidence of neutropenia and 
      thrombocytopenia (8.7% vs. 29.5%, P= 0.012; 8.7% vs. 18.2%, P= 0.186). Other 
      adverse events were similar in both groups, and most adverse events were grade 
      I/II and resolved spontaneously. CONCLUSION: Intranasal GM-CSF enhances the 
      efficacy of the local ACNU administration combined with oral temozolomide 
      chemotherapy. The survival and performance status were significantly improved in 
      patients with glioblastoma after surgery. Additionally, the GM-CSF therapy was 
      able to reduce the occurrence of chemotherapy-related neutropenia and 
      thrombocytopenia.

TI  - Health-related quality of life in early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma: a longitudinal 
      analysis of the ABVD arm in the randomized controlled trial HD.6.
PG  - 256
LID - 10.1007/s00520-023-07717-3 [doi]
AB  - Early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma has become one of the most curable hematologic 
      malignancies. Depending upon the disease location, possible toxicities, and 
      patient preference, chemotherapy alone with ABVD remains an accepted treatment 
      modality for this disease. There remains a paucity of data regarding the 
      longitudinal trajectory of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients 
      treated for HL. The impact of disease and treatment on HRQoL is increasingly 
      important to understand as the number of long-term survivors increases. We report 
      the longitudinal HRQoL using data prospectively collected from diagnosis up to 10 
      years post-treatment in the ABVD arm of the HD.6 randomized controlled trial for 
      early-stage HL patients (N=169). We analyzed HRQoL using the EORTC QLQ-C30 
      collected at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after completion of 
      chemotherapy and yearly up to year 10. Clinically and statistically significant 
      improvements were noted for specific domains including emotional (3 months 
      post-treatment), social (12 months post-treatment) and financial functioning (2 
      years post-treatment), and the specific symptom of fatigue (6 months 
      post-treatment) during the follow-up period. To our knowledge, this is the first 
      prospective, longitudinal analysis of HRQoL specifically among patients with 
      early-stage HL treated with ABVD therapy alone. Although improvements were noted, 
      sustained clinically and statistically significant improvements were noted only 
      in select symptoms emphasizing the need to better understand and optimize HRQoL 
      among this patient group.
